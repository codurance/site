Our first try into creating a regular podcast, where Chris Reinmuller, Sam Davies and myself discuss about the talk done by Martin Fowler at AgileAus 2018.

The actual talk can be found [here](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/agile-2018)

The book [Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/) is now available.
