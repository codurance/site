Ah, finally some editing (very lightly). Cristina, Alvaro and Alfredo told me all about the Software Crafters Barcelona Conference that happened between the 29 and 30 of September. For being our first remote call went quite nice. Although next time I need to have the video running, things go "swoosh" by me when I have visual clues; without them, I am even slower processing.
