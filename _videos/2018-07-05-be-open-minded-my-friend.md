## Be open-minded, my friend (Spanish)

What's the reason why we tend to have strong opinions about certain technical subjects with no shades of gray? We experience cognitive distortions and biases. 

In this presentation, Raquel takes us on a journey along different technical subjects (pull requests, branching, TDD, pair programming, OOP vs. FP, documentation, ...), because travelling opens our mind, makes us better people and helps us to consider things from new perspectives.
