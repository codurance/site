## Screencast - Mouseless Programming, Part I

This is the first video of the Mouseless Programming screencast. A simple leap year kata is performed, using TDD process, File and Live templates, and some automatic refactoring tools.

Both mouse and keyboard were used in this video.

This video is a part of the blog post [Mouseless Programming]({{site.baseurl}}/2015/11/25/mouseless-programming/).
