## Silent talk: Software as a craft

This is the slide deck of the talk and it includes some extra slides as intertitles in the same way as a silent film.

This talk happened at the University of Tarragona (URV) with a lot of students as attendees. It encourages to strive for a learning culture and being better professionals in software development.
