A new sprint starts and you have to implement a new feature, you naively open the file where the functionality ought to live. To your great horror, a five headed monster seats there scaring the hell out of any developer trying to change that file.
You know the time has come to act.
Protected by our unit tests and armed with courage and ReSharper, we will refactor legacy code using some of the refactorings listed in Martin Fowler’s “Refactoring” book.
Rest assured, we’ll stay in green all the time.
Although the code is in C#, the refactoring examples in this session can be applied to any other Object-Oriented language.
