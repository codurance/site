Our conference this year coincides with the 10th anniversary of of the birth of Software Craftsmanship movement!

We're busy gathering an amazing line-up of speakers including favourites from SCLConf 2017. From your valuable feedback we were pleased to see the quality of the talks was judged to be extremely high - even better than we had hoped for! Launching the Software Craftsmanship Conference in 2017 was an experiment. Looking back, we are very proud with the response and to see the interest that exists for the craftsmanship mindset.

This year is special. Our conference coincides with the 10th anniversary of Software Craftsmanship movement. In 2008, a number of aspiring software craftsmen met in Libertyville, Illinois with the intent of establishing a set of principles for Software Craftsmanship. We believe this is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the moment that started the Software Craftsmanship movement.
