Hacking Authority: What factors give people authority, and how can our teams thrive amidst overlapping systems of authority? Matthew will look at some historical and sociological models, and consider how they can help us understand explicit and implicit power structures in our organisations. We'll finish by looking at how to interact with — and even exploit — these systems.
