As Software Craftsmen, we dedicate a lot of our time towards continuous learning and self-improvement. Whether thats reading blogs, watching videos or attending events together, we get the opportunity to debate pros and cons, form our own opinions and keep up to speed on what's developing in the community.

We've wanted to share more significant resources from our reading list and our events calendar with the wider community for some time. Hence this newsletter.

We are aiming to send this newsletter on a monthly basis. This may change to become more frequent if we feel that there is enough interest. If you'd like to receive this in your inbox then please subscribe using the form on this page.
