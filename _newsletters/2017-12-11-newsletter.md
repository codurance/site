Hi,

This month, we look at: The OSWASP Top 10, Software Design Bias, Functional Programming, IDE setup for Rust, and Setting up an AI experiment to play Tetris. Enjoy!

The Codurance Team

## Our Opinion On ... OWASP Top 10
Since the publication of the last Codurance newsletter, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has released the latest version of the renowned [OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/images/7/72/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf).

The OWASP Top 10 is a periodically updated document, designed to promote an awareness of the most common and critical security risks to web applications. The list is compiled by a project team which includes a variety of security experts from around the world.

Although injection flaws (such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection) remain at the top of the list, since its last revision in 2013, three new risks have been added — XML External Entities (XXE), Insecure Deserialization, and Insufficient Logging and Monitoring. This last item, Insufficient Logging and Monitoring, is particularly interesting.

Unfortunately, I have seen many projects where logging and monitoring tasks have been given a lower priority than the building of features deemed to be delivering direct business value. In reality though, retrofitting a sufficient logging and monitoring solution into a modern complex and distributed system is hugely time-consuming and error-prone. The more complex and distributed that a system becomes, the more critical comprehensive logging and monitoring are for supporting the application in production, further compounding the problem.

In addition to production support requirements, studies have shown that the time to detect a system breach is typically over 200 days and, shockingly, such breaches are more often detected by external parties than by internal processes such as monitoring or automated anomaly detection. This extended time from breach to detection gives attackers freedom to further attack systems, gather or destroy sensitive data and find further exploits.

At Codurance we advocate building a [Walking Skeleton](https://codurance.com/2015/08/26/My-first-walking-skeleton/) as the first phase of any software project. Logging and monitoring should be implemented as part of this phase and in such a way as to make it easy for developers to record activities such as login, access control failures, and server-side input validation failures, with sufficient user context for application support systems to easily detect and investigate important incidents.
