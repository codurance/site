Hi,

This month we've taken a look at Global Day of Code Retreat, Etsys' (excellent) Debriefing Facilitation Guide and takeaway lessons from a failed Tetris AI experiment.

The Codurance Team

## Our Opinion On ...
------------------------------------------------------------
On 18th November last year, we celebrated the Global Day of Coderetreat (GDCR), both in London and Barcelona. It’s an annual event in which Coderetreats take place simultaneously around all the world as a globally coordinated effort to improve software developer’s skills. In this case, 136 events were held in cities all over the globe.

For those people who never attended a Coderetreat, it's a full day event where we try to solve the same problem with different constraints. It's a way to practice and improve our craft, through experimenting, sharing and learning new things.

Coderetreats started in 2009, with the current format emerging in 2010 after sharing experiences from previous event. We acknowledge the work of those who are responsible for the organization of the GDCR year after year, and in particularly those who were there at the beginning: Corey Haines, Gary Bernhardt, Nayan Hajratwala, Patrick Welsh, Alex Bolboaca, Maria Diaconu, Erik Talboom, Adrian Bolboaca, Jim Hurne, Martin Klose and Alissa Conaty, to name a few.

Several weeks before GDCR, we hosted our first Legacy Coderetreat. We were encouraged by the high turnout for both of these events and continue to be inspired by the contribution made from the folks that attend. We’ll continue working with this format of practising, because it breaks comfort zones when facing problems in a different way, as well as it helps to grow the community. See you in the next Coderetreat!

Next year is special. Our conference coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Software Craftsmanship movement. In 2008, a number of aspiring software craftspeople met in Libertyville, Illinois with the intent of establishing a set of principles for Software Craftsmanship. We believe this is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the moment that started the Software Craftsmanship movement.
