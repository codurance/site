Hi,

This month we've included everything you ever wanted to know about F# Active Patterns, why developers find it difficult to convince managers to let them 'do TDD', the results of GitHub's Open Source developer survey and a note on transparent salaries. Phew.

Kind regards,
The Codurance Team

P.S P.S Missed our first newsletter? Catch up [here](https://codurance.com/newsletters/2017-05-17-newsletter/) 

P.P.S Have you written something that you'd to share with the Software Craftsmanship community? Perhaps you'd like us to include a topic that we have yet to cover? Reply to this email and we'll try and make it happen.


## Our opinion on... open financials and open salaries.

Since we started Codurance, we always wanted to have our employees involved with all aspects of our business. Besides trusting them as craftsmen, we would love to have their input on how to build a great company. In order to maximise everyone’s contribution, we felt that everyone should have access to the same amount of information, and that includes all the financials and salaries. Although scary, we knew that it was the right thing to do. So, 2.5 years ago we opened all our financials. From that day, every single employee has had full access to the company’s financials. This includes: Salaries, Revenues by project, Project contract details, Assets, Liabilities, Cashflow, Costs, and Taxes we pay.

Looking back, it was one of the best decisions we’ve made. That decision supported our culture of openness and transparency. Two and half years later and 3 times bigger in size, we can have very open conversations about the direction of our business, the importance of each client, we can discuss which benefits we can provide, we can openly discuss new hires, which investments we are all comfortable to make, and many other things. Codurance would never be the company it is today without the open contributions from all our people. There is no elephant in the room anymore and we can all focus on making our company a place that we all love.

We often get asked questions along the lines of 'how do I convince my manager to allow us to do TDD'. Sandro's blog post looks at why focusing on practices, rather than starting with solutions and working backwards, often holds development teams back from introducing new technical practices.

'For a theory even to be wrong, it must be predictive and testable and falsifiable. If it cannot be falsified - if it does not make some prediction that _could in theory_ be tested and proven false - then it does not count as science.'
