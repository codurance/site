			<p>Due to its importance, this appendix should have been introduced as a proper chapter. As with everything that becomes popular, there are many misconceptions about Software Craftsmanship. This appendix addresses many of them including: the difference between developers and craftsmen; elitism; the old metaphor— apprentice, journeyman and master; the role of a master craftsman; differences between Craftsmanship and XP; narrow focus and technical practices; clarifications about some points made earlier in the book about Agile Coaches and managers.</p>
