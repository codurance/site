   title: Who are we?
   subtitle: <p>We build well-crafted software and help development teams to get better at continuously delivering software through the application of Extreme Programming practices and Software Craftsmanship values. Software Craftsmanship is at the heart of our company. In 2010, the founders started the <a href="http://londonswcraft.com/">London Software Craftsmanship Community (LSCC)</a> which has grown to become the largest and most active Software Craftsmanship community in the world, with more than 3,500 developers that meet a few times a month to share and learn. Codurance was founded in 2013 and inherited the same community spirit. Since 2013, we have been organising <a href="http://socratesuk.org/">SoCraTes UK</a>&mdash;an International Software Craftsmanship Gathering that attracts software crafts[wo]men from all over Europe.
                </p>
                <p>Our craftsmen are renowned for their technology expertise especially in Web, Devops, Big Data, Continuous Delivery, and Cloud Platforms. We present at many conferences around the world; write <a href="http://codurance.com/publications/posts/">blogs</a>; and create <a href="http://codurance.com/publications/videos/">screencasts</a>.

   title: Our culture
   subtitle: <p>Our craftsmen, craftswomen, and apprentices are at the core of our company. We call ourselves craftsmen and craftswomen as a way to express the passion we have for creating well-crafted software. As most of us came to Codurance through the Craftsmanship communities (London and a few others in Europe), it is in our DNA to run many internal sessions where we learn from and share knowledge with each other. Our people are never alone, even when they are working with a client. We are constantly helping each other, regardless which project we are working on.</p>
                <p>Transparency is one of our key values. Every person inside Codurance has full access to the company's financials and each other salaries. There are no hierarchies or managers in the company. Any small group of people who feel passionate about a subject or want to change how things are done in the company can start an Initiative. The group consider all the people who may be impacted by their decision and accept any person interested in the subject to join the group. The group is then empowered to make the decision.</p>
                <p>Agile and Lean principles are also at our core&mdash;any decision made now can be changed later. This allows us to always move forward, try new things, inspect and adapt.</p>

Equally, our craftsmen are effective team members, committed to building the right software in the most effective way. We let our work speak for itself. We strive to constantly improve our selves, our team, and the projects we work in. Our craftsmen are pragmatic and understand that&#58; knowing where to apply a particular approach is as important as knowing how to apply it.</p>
           <p>We fully understand and embrace Agile processes and practices. We are skilled in practices such as TDD, Continuous Integration, Pair Programming, and Continuous Deployment.</p>
           <p> Our knowledge of technology is broad across the company and deep within the individuals.

   title: Oustide-In Test Driven Development (part I)
   description: <p>Unlike previous screencasts, this tutorial is not aimed at those starting to learn TDD. Inspired by recent <a href="https://twitter.com/sandromancuso/status/588503877235781632"> discussions on Twitter</a> and a public discussion about TDD and Software Design, Sandro Mancuso decided to record a video showing how he normally codes, which is different from how he normally teaches.</p>
           <p>In this 3-part screencast you will be able to follow Sandro's "just in time" design approach and understand the rationale behind some of his recent comments. You will notice that he does not always follow rules and that he relies more on his own intuition to drive his design. Thinking out loud throughout the video, Sandro aims to help you follow everything that he is considering whilst writing each test and refactoring code. This video provides a good example of 'Outside-In' TDD and demonstrates the key ways it differs from the Classicist approach.</p>
                        <p>If you are TDD novice, don't follow the advice from these videos blindly. Favour the classicist approach, design less up-front, and get feedback from your code before evolving your design.</p> <p>For more about the differences between TDD styles, please check Sandro's blog post <a href="http://codurance.com/2015/05/12/does-tdd-lead-to-good-design/">Does TDD really lead to good design?</a></p>
                        <p>For part 2 and 3 of this video series, <a href="/videos">visit our videos page</a>.</p>

  ASOS:
    metaheader: A Software Craftmanship mindset helped ASOS's teams to deliver value more frequently.
    subtitle: A multi-staged, multi-team manual deployment process was having a negative impact on the organisations ability to deploy changes frequently. Software Craftsmanship was seen as a way to raise overall code quality, whilst providing a platform for the journey to Continuous Delivery.
    about: ASOS is an online fashion retailer, selling cutting-edge fashion and supporting a thriving fashion community Having started as a fashion blog, the brand now offers its clients mobile apps and a magazine in addition to its website offering Last year, ASOS had over 13.4 million active customers. 
    the_challenge: <p>With over 123 million unique visits to their site per month and with 95 million page views per day, ASOS were struggling to adapt their systems and to ensure performance during peak periods (e g Black Friday). One of the key problems was a multi-stage, multi-team manual deployment process requiring the coordination of a large number of staff and manual testing.</p>
                   <p>In an effort to modernise and improve their IT capabilities, ASOS underwent a programme to improve the speed of change, the ease, and rate of delivery and a general upskilling of staff in this area. They realised they were missing some key skills, particularly around agile technical practices, and asked us to help.</p>
    our_sc_approach: <p>We helped by rapidly building and re-architecting some of their core systems, adding in levels of redundancy and caching that allowed them to cope with peak traffic. We also built fallover contingency libraries to implement cross-region disaster recovery and implemented cross-region high availability clusters.</p>
                     <p>The work was in NET ASP NET MVC with SQL Azure databases, hosted in Azure The site also employed some open source caching technologies such as Redis, to improve availability. </p>
                     <p>Whilst their existing development teams were already fairly established, particularly around Agile processes, we identified the need for these teams to be upskilled technical Agile practices We implemented a large-scale Software Craftsmanship coaching program across their 40+ development teams, introducing or reinforcing key skills around <a href="/services">Extreme Programming (XP)</a>, TDD, SOLID principles, <a href="/services">Continuous Integration</a>, <a href="/services">Continuous Delivery</a> and a <a href="/services">culture of DevOps</a> </p>
    outcome: <p>ASOS has made significant steps along the road to Agile software development, adopting a host of new techniques rapidly Iterations are more organized and ceremonies are delivering more value.</p>
             <p>We changed the technical practices within the team, raising the overall quality of code. Several team members that went through the training courses have been promoted into key engineering leadership positions.</p>
             <p>ASOS continues to thrive and improve and we are proud of the help we provided while there We believe that ASOS's attitude and desire for growth and change aligned well with Codurance's expertise, coaching, and support, resulting in many enriching experiences for ASOS's staff.</p>
  Tesco:
    metaheader: Software Craftsmanship helped Tesco to greatly increase their Supply Chain forecasting accuracy ...
    subtitle: <p>Tesco wanted to improve their ability to run promotions and store discount by updating their legacy mainframe application.
Software craftsmanship was seen as an ideal way to set the foundations for building a new solution.</p>
    about: Tesco is a British multinational grocery and general merchandise retailer. With revenues of over £54 billion and with close to 7,000 stores worldwide, Tesco has established itself as the fifth-largest retailer globally and as the market leader in the UK.
    the_challenge: <p>Tesco’s Supply Chain division were forecasting product demand on a legacy mainframe application. Changes were made to the forecasts using external tools (for instance, spreadsheets), which was having a negative impact on the business ability to trace irregularities. Without improvements to the existing application, the business was constrained in its ability to run discounted campaigns and special offers to its store customers.</p>
                   <p>Tesco wanted to build a new API that would help to solve this problem and to raise code quality within the existing development team. We were invited to work on this project based on our previous work at Tesco.</p>
    our_sc_approach: <p>With two of our Software Craftsmen leading their existing team, we built the new API from the ground up. Worked in conjunction with the development team in Bangalore (India), we created a webapp that would help demand planners to order the right amount of product from suppliers. This webapp was connected to the legacy database through the new custom API.</p>
                     <p>In addition to the functional work, we also set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline and infrastructure for running the application in production. Our day to day interactions with the team also saw us upskilling individuals on Software Craftsmanship techniques such as Test Driven Development (TDD) and Refactoring. Furthermore, we helped the Product Owner to improve the requirements and advised on project strategy. We supported the partner team in Bangalore to restructure their tests and establish a better Git workflow.</p>
    outcome: <p>We built a strong and sustainable solution that has enabled Tesco to greatly increase their forecasting accuracy. We had a positive impact on the technical and professional development of the team.</p>
