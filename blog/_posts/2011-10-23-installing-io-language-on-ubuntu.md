Since I'm new to Ubuntu and I had a hard time installing [Io language](http://iolanguage.com/), I've decided to record my steps.
Hopefully I'll remember all of them and other people won't struggle as
much as I did. I'm running Ubuntu 11.10.

The main problem I had was that I did not have all the dependencies
needed to install Io and the installation was failing. The dependencies
are [yajl](https://github.com/lloyd/yajl) and
[libevent](http://libevent.org/)

If you've got then installed, you can skip the next steps.

**NOTE**: You will need to have cmake and make. You can install them
running the following commands from the terminal:

{% highlight console %}
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install make
{% endhighlight %}


###Installing yajl


Download yajl from
here: [https://github.com/lloyd/yajl/downloads](https://github.com/lloyd/yajl/downloads)

1.  In my case it was: lloyd-yajl-2.0.1-0-gf4b2b1a.zip

Extract it into a folder.

Open the terminal and go to the folder you extracted yajl

Run the following commands

{% highlight console %}
1.  mkdir build
2.  cd build
3.  cmake ..
4.  sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

For more information, please check:

###Installing libevent

Download libevent from
here: [http://libevent.org/](http://libevent.org/)

1.  In my case it was: libevent-2.0.15-stable.tar.gz

Extract it into a folder

Open the terminal and go to the folder you extracted libevent

Run the following commands

{% highlight console %}
1.  ./configure
2.  make
3.  sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

For more information please check:
[http://libevent.org/](http://libevent.org/)
Also check the README file inside the .tar.gz for your version

###Installing Io language

You can go to the [Io language website](http://iolanguage.com/) and
download the language or click
[here](http://github.com/stevedekorte/io/zipball/master) to go start
downloading it. As there is no Ubuntu package for that, you will be
downloading the Io's source code. This will point to [Steve Dekorte's version](https://github.com/stevedekorte/io). I ended up downloading
[Jeremy Tregunna's version](https://github.com/jeremytregunna/io). It
should work the same. Check each one is the most up-to-date.


Download the Io version
here: [https://github.com/jeremytregunna/io/zipball/master](https://github.com/jeremytregunna/io/zipball/master)

Extract it into a folder.

Open the terminal and go to the folder you extracted Io

Run the following commands:

{% highlight console %}
1.  mkdir build
2.  cd build
3.  cmake ..
4.  sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

**IMPORTANT**: When running ```cmake ..```, you may get a few errors. Even
then, try to run ```sudo make install```. Some libraries may fail to compile
because they are OS specific.

For mode information please check:

###Updating ld.so.conf

Now we just need to update ld.so.conf so Io can be accessed from
anywhere in your computer.


1.  From the terminal, type the following command: ```sudo gedit /etc/ld.so.conf```
2.  Add the following line to the file: ```include /usr/local/lib```
3.  Save and close the file
4.  From the terminal run the following command: ```sudo ldconfig```

###Running Io

That's it. Hopefully now you will be able to open a terminal window and
type: ```io```
You should see the Io runtime environment: ```Io> _```
