On 4th of March 2014, a few days before my baby boy Samuel completed two months, a well-regarded cardiologist—let's call him _Dr. Smith_—gave us the news that Samuel had a heart condition called [pulmonary valve stenosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_valve_stenosis). Dr. Smith's recommendation was that Samuel had a heart procedure called [balloon pulmonary valvotomy](http://tchin.org/resource_room/c_art_02.htm) or [ballon valvuloplasty](http://tchin.org/resource_room/c_art_02.htm) as soon as possible. The procedure was scheduled to 11th of March 2014, on [The Harley Street Clinic](http://theharleystreetclinic.co.uk/). Needless to say, the whole family was devastated.

On the 6th of March, just two days after we got the news, we received a letter from Dr. Smith. On the letter, he described his diagnosis, the history of our interaction, the exams he conducted, and his recommendation—all in a simple and accessible language. The letter was personal and caring; with words like _"I was delighted to see Samuel on the 4th March for a cardiac assessment"_ and _"Thank you for involving me in the care of this delightful family"_

Samuel's heart procedure was done today, at 8:30am, and lasted 90 minutes. My wife, my mother-in-law, and I stayed at our hospital room waiting for the news. Around 10am, Dr. Smith entered our room, still dressed in his [green scrub](http://www.livescience.com/32450-why-do-doctors-wear-green-or-blue-scrubs-.html), and gave us the good news. _"The procedure was a success. Perfect. I couldn't hope for a better result. Samuel is doing well and you will soon be able to see him,"_ he said with a big smile while shaking our hands. Tears. Happy tears. Our two-month old baby boy was going to be OK.

Just before midday, a couple of hours after Dr. Smith gave us the news, I was outside of the hospital building, smoking my electronic cigarette, and thinking about everything we went through in the past seven days. I then saw Dr. Smith, leaving the hospital building. He was wearing normal clothes, carrying a briefcase, looking like any other ordinary man. He was slowly walking away from where I was. He was happy. I could feel it. As he walked away, I kept following him with my eyes thinking: the work and talent of that ordinary-looking man just made a huge difference in Samuel's life. Our lives. Because of him, a two-month old boy will now have a normal life. As Dr. Smith walked away, with tears in my eyes, I silently said _"Thank you."_

I don't know where Dr. Smith was going—probably to get some lunch and get ready to make a difference in someone else's life in the afternoon. At 9pm, Dr. Smith was back to check on Samuel. He conducted a few more exams and said that Samuel was good to go home in the morning. _"Nothing to worry about. Everything went according to plan. Although we will still need to do a few follow ups as Samuel grows, he is ready for a perfectly normal life."_

For Dr. Smith, this was just another day at the office. Another ordinary day where his mastery in conducting heart procedures made a difference to someone’s life. Another ordinary day when he will get home and feel proud—proud of his craft and his skills; proud of being a great professional; proud of making a difference. Another ordinary day... Everyday.
