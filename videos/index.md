            <p>Highly Strung: Understanding your Type System<p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Strings suck. I mean, seriously, they're awful. They can be quite literally anything. How do you know what a string is? Look inside it. But first, run your program, because you can't look inside it until then.</p>

            <p>Want to change the way a string behaves? OK, go change all the functions that deal with that string. How do you know which functions? Well, it could be any of them. Better go fix them all.</p>

            <p>Say you've got two strings. We want one string out. So we can stick them together with the + operator! Except wait, one of them is SQL (or HTML, or JavaScript, or…). So better escape the other one first! Which one? Probably the second one. It's usually the second one.</p>

            <p>This all makes me go AAAAAAAAARRRRGGHHHHHHHHHH.</p>

            <p>Let's do this better. I want to talk to you about using your type system to make all these problems go away (at least from the core of your code), and as a bonus, we'll end up with much more expressive, readable, maintainable and most importantly, correct code.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="description">
             <p>Do you find working with legacy code tough? No tests, no documentation, and fear of breaking other parts of the code. Join Sandro Mancuso who will show you the only way to deal with these problems is to test and refactor merciless.</p>

            <p>For the majority of us, legacy code is part of our life and learning how to embrace it can make things far more enjoyable. In this live coding session, Sandro will be demonstrating how to overcome the most common problems found when testing legacy code.</p>

            <p>He will be taking a piece of messy Java code, test it until is 100% covered and then show how to refactor it in order to bring the business language and requirements to life.</p>

            <p>This session is full of tips and tricks you can start applying immediately. Although the code is in Java, the same principles can be applied in any language</p>

        <div class="description">
             <p>It's been 12 years since Pete McBreen's book and 5 years since the Software Craftsmanship summit. So, what is the current state of Software Craftsmanship? If there is a Software Craftsmanship movement, where is it? What is it? Is it an elitist movement? Is Software Craftsmanship becoming a religion? Does it have a narrow focus? Is Software Craftsmanship just XP rebranded? Does it fit large organisations? In this presentation, Sandro will be talking about the current state of Software Craftsmanship, explaining its values and addressing some of its biggest criticisms.</p>

            <p>4 Rules of Simple Design –> Higher-Order Functions<p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
             <p>Quoting @jbrains, “A design is simple to the extent that it:
                <ol>
                    <li>Passes its tests</li>
                    <li>Minimizes duplication</li>
                    <li>Maximizes clarity</li>
                    <li>Has fewer elements"</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>I want to demonstrate how object-oriented principles can only get you so far in simplifying your design.
            Starting with a clean yet completely imperative code base written in Java, I will explain how we can improve the code by applying functional principles—primarily extracting functions as objects and passing them around.
            Along the way, I will be pointing out how each refactor simplifies the code according to one or more of the four rules.
            We will start by removing duplication, even where duplication isn’t apparent from an OO point of view, before making the code clearer by replacing the language of the system by the language of our domain. Along the way, we’ll reduce the number of moving parts and increase test coverage.
            <p>I will also show existing libraries in Java and C# that can help you refactor your own code to be smaller and more understandable.</p>
            <p>This is a live coding presentation. There will be no slides, just lots of refactoring on a projector. You will not need any understanding of functional programming in order to attend.</p>

        <div class="description">
             <p>Functional programming is becoming more and more popular, and for good reasons, but now a big number of developers are bashing Object Oriented Programming. However, how much do we really know about Object Oriented Programming? Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism is OOP for kids. In this talk Sandro will be explaining many OOP/OOD principles and practices that every developer should always have in their minds before writing any line of code. You will also notice that many of these principles also apply to different programming paradigms like functional programming.</p>

            <p>Testing and Refactoring Legacy Code<p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
             <p>In this video, we take a piece of crappy Java code with no tests. Our objective is to write tests for it and then refactor to make it better. The code has the most common problems that much larger legacy applications have, like Singletons, static calls and feature envy. It also has some design problems. Fixing that is quite hard, mainly when we need to write all the tests before we start the refactoring. Another rule: We cannot change production code if it is not covered by tests but quite often we need to change the production code in order to be able to test it. How to solve this problem? Well, I hope I can answer all these questions in this video.

        </div>
        <div class="description">
             <p>Agile adoption brings into focus the shortcomings in the existing engineering practices. After undergoing an Agile transformation for a few years at UBS, where the focus was heavy on process and light on the technical disciplines, it is an understatement to say that we still have problems. We call this the Agile Hangover. Focusing on the technical practices is essential to a successful software project, regardless of the process. Software Craftsmanship principles have been essential in tackling the problems we face.</p>
             <p>In this talk we will share our experiences in how we are trying to find the right balance between technical practices and processes. Empowered professional software engineers, well defined testing strategy, process automation, high investment in people development, requirements management and strong emphasis on quality have been the key areas our focus.</p>
