##Craftsmanship: A Few Years On
It's been 12 years since Pete McBreen's book and 5 years since the Software Craftsmanship summit. So, what is the current state of Software Craftsmanship? If there is a Software Craftsmanship movement, where is it? What is it? Is it an elitist movement? Is Software Craftsmanship becoming a religion? Does it have a narrow focus? Is Software Craftsmanship just XP rebranded? Does it fit large organisations? In this presentation, Sandro will be talking about the current state of Software Craftsmanship, explaining its values and addressing some of its biggest criticisms.
