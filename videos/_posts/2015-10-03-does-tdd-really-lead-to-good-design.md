##Does TDD really lead to good design?

“TDD is a design tool.” That’s what I’ve said for years. But not anymore. After working with different teams in different organisations, I realised that I don’t believe anymore that TDD is a design tool. In this talk I’ll be explaining the pros and cons of the two main styles of TDD, discuss why some developers can test-drive well-crafted code while others can’t, and also explain how to reason about design decisions.

For more about the differences between TDD styles, please check Sandro's blog post [Does TDD really lead to good design?]("2015/05/12/does-tdd-lead-to-good-design/")
