                    to
                    get better at their craft through training, coaching and mentoring, and we help companies to get
                    better
                    at delivering software.</p>

                <p><b>We collaborate with our clients.</b> We built our reputation based on client satisfaction and
                    adding

                <p><b>We have values.</b> We don't negotiate on quality. We use Agile methodologies and Extreme
                    Programming

                    all our projects.</p>

                    <p>Software Craftsmanship principles are at the heart of our company. Software Craftsmanship is a movement that aims to bring professionalism to our industry. It's main principles are highlighted in the <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship manifesto</a>:</p>
                    <ul class="list-unstyled">

			</li>
			<li>
			    <i class="fa fa-tick"></i>Not only responding to change but also
			    <strong>steadily adding value.</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
			    <i class="fa fa-tick"></i>Not only individuals and interactions but also a
			    <strong>community of professionals.</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
			    <i class="fa fa-tick"></i>Not only customer collaboration but also
			    <strong>productive partnerships</strong>
			</li>
                    </ul>
