Hello,

It has been a busy few months for the team and we're pleased to bring the newsletter back, including some useful resources for you to take advantage of, such as an article on 'The Fine Art of Fast Development', a talk on building 'Sustainable and Empathetic Cross-Functional Teams' and, if you haven't already checked it out yet, [Katalyst](https://katalyst.codurance.com/), our new handy skill-honing tool. Please feel free to share the newsletter with your colleagues for their own learning and development! 

Until next time, 
The Codurance team


## Consistent Growth and Exciting Changes
### By Sandro Mancuso and Mash Badar
------------------------------------------------------------
Since our last update, we're delighted to report Codurance's continued expansion, with new homes for both the London and Barcelona offices and the launch of Software Crafters North, a group run by our new Manchester branch as we continue to grow. SC London returns this October for a third consecutive year, with a raft of impressive thought-leaders scheduled to share their crafting expertise with the community - we're looking forward to seeing you there!

We kicked off 2019 by achieving [AWS Partner Status](https://codurance.com/2019/01/15/codurance-gain-aws-partner-status/), recognising the expertise, skill and experience of our people in the AWS Cloud ecosystem and its various services. As part of our commitment to contributing to the development community, we're pleased to announce that 7 of our talented apprentices have recently graduated to Craftsperson level, creating expert practitioners able to contribute to and share Craftsmanship values within the software development realm.

Last but by no means least, we've had the pleasure of working on some truly exciting international client projects - coaching, advising and delivering exceptional software. We're excited to see what's next for the business over the course of the rest of the year and welcome you to follow our journey.

Creating well-crafted software and contributing to best practice is our passion and therefore we have created Katalyst, a portal to share some of the programming problems that we use to teach and practice software development.
