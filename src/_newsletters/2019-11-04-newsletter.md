Hello!

October proved to be an exciting month for Codurance, with 8 new hires joining us in a variety of roles. We had the opportunity to gather all of our UK-based colleagues in one place via a company Open Space day, where all were encouraged to engage in discussions across a variety of topics. These bi-monthly events are an essential component of what makes life at Codurance special and the wonderful feedback from our team reflected this.

In this month's newsletter, David Hall provides a recap on a very successful SC London 2019, we provide examples of useful walkthroughs such as Andre Torres' introduction to the Elastic Stack and recommend some great reading materials.  

Until next time, 
The Codurance team


## Our Reflection on SC London 2019
### By David Hall
------------------------------------------------------------
SC London 2019 took place on the 3rd and 4th October. For the third year running, we were delighted to bring together amazing speakers, sponsors and attendees from across the world. Our talks this year covered a broad range of topics, from Sandro Mancuso on aligning product and technology design through to Aslak Helesoy on TDD with Petri nets. If you haven’t seen them already, make sure to check out all of the videos from this year’s event, [here](https://sc-london.com/2019/videos).

Several people had asked about how to find a local Craftsmanship community. The Software Crafters Slack channel is a good place to start. For those that are interested in starting their own community, [Sandro’s article](https://codurance.com/2013/11/21/starting-craftsmanship-communities/) from 2013 contains lots of useful advice. 

We are busy working through the feedback and will be making an announcement about SC London 2020 very soon. Make sure to keep an eye out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sclconf), or sign-up to the mailing list, [here](https://codurance.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=95b09f6a86b4c4551e15d7cc3&id=300e1ca3cc).
