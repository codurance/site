Hello!

The close of 2019 is a natural time for a period of reflection. This year has been one of great change and growth for Codurance, welcoming many new Craftspeople to the company and engaging with clients on groundbreaking new projects. While we are pleased to celebrate our business successes, we're equally and immensely proud that our ethos and values have continued to resonate across our flourishing teams.  

In this issue of our newsletter, we are pleased to include an important message from our company founders, contemplating on the nature of our craft and our place within the community. Our talented Craftspeople have been busy hosting webinars, publishing books and writing informative blog posts for your perusal. We hope that you find these resources useful for sharing and discussing within your own teams. 

We would like to take this opportunity to wish you a happy festive season and a prosperous new year ahead. 

Until next time, 

The Codurance team


## A reflection on Software Craftsmanship
### By Mash Badar and Sandro Mancuso
------------------------------------------------------------
“Making things by hand” is an innate part of how we work. It involves manipulation or shaping of a material with a type-form in our minds to achieve a certain result. There is constant sensory feedback, whether that is through touch, sight, feel or a combination of those. It is about a constant evolution of the desired outcome, in our minds, according to our changing understanding of the material and the desired outcome. It is a constant connection between the hand, the senses, and the mind. It is an act of making. We would argue that software development is an act of making and thus can be labelled as a craft. That is not a metaphor, it is a label for people who see the act of making software through this perspective.
 
Once we take the view that Software Craftsmanship is not a metaphor, we also break the restrictions that a metaphor imposes. The practices associated with software development do not need to be tied to other crafts throughout history. We can learn from those crafts and associated practices, adopt and adapt the ones that are relevant and ignore the ones that are not. We can come up with our own practices (e.g. Agile and XP practices) that are different because our craft is different from the others, just as other crafts are different from each other. In fact, we take that view already and we are not blindly following the archaic practices of crafts from the past. However, we are learning lessons from that history to take our craft into the future.
 
We understand the importance of community and inclusivity to ensure that our craft draws from the beautiful diversity that humanity offers us. We say this because we see it within the Software Craftsmanship communities that we have the pleasure to be a part of. The spirit of that same community lives in our company. We are dedicated to teaching and learning, whether that is within our community or within our clients who are invariably drawn to our community once they experience it first-hand.
 
Our craft is young but we like to think that we are making a difference towards its better future.
