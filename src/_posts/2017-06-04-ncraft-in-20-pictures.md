[NCrafts](http://ncrafts.io/) 2017 is a two days conference in Paris. I had the chance to also attend an event storming workshop run by Alberto Brandolini a day before the conference.
It was full of fun, socialising and learning.

Here are some of my takeways of those three days of awesomeness:

{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/event-storming-with-brandolini.jpg "Alberto Brandolini adding a post-it to a wall covered in post-its" %}
"If you have an event driven architecture, the gap between post-its (resulting from the event storming session) and the code should be small". [Alberto Brandolini](http://twitter.com/ziobrando).

{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/ncraft-buffet.jpg "Food buffet at NCrafts" %}
Good food always makes for a good conference (you guessed I'm french here).


{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/customised-keyboard.jpg "A custom built keyboard - including android, apple and DON'T PANIC keys" %}
Developers are fun and keyboards are a good way to socialise.


{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/bigdata-at-criteo.jpg "Fundamental Lessons: Know your dependencies, eliminate your dependency on the internet, use a cache" %}
Big data can be so big [you DDOS yourself](http://ncrafts.io/speaker/SavarinAnna).


{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/mob-testing-live-demo.png "Slides about mobbing" %}
[Mobbing is not just for devs](http://ncrafts.io/speaker/maaretp).


{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/webber-on-communities-of-practice.jpg "Building Communities of practice (tacit.pub/tacitbooks)" %}
[Community of practices](http://ncrafts.io/speaker/ewebber) are efficient ways to break team silo.


{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/xp-at-unruly.jpg "Word Cloud of Extreme Practices" %}
[XP to the extreme](http://ncrafts.io/speaker/rachelcdavies) works.


{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/ncrafted-beer.jpg "A bottle of Newcrafts Black IPA" %}
Craft beer is a must have, looking forward to the veggie smoothie trend.


{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/sabine-safi-about-going-teal-2.jpg "Slide about Reinventing Organizations: The Epiphany" %}
[Becoming TEAL overnight](http://ncrafts.io/speaker/SabineSafi) might not be a good idea, I feel lucky to be part of a TEAL aspiring company.


{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/sabine-safi-about-going-teal.jpg "Slide stating 'Biggest Mistakes'" %}
The best talks are the one full of courage to face one's vulnerabilities.


{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/168-hour-week.png "Antoine Vernois with photos of chickens and a building." %}
[Coding among the chickens](http://ncrafts.io/speaker/avernois) sounds like something I would enjoy doing.


{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/ncraft-open-space.jpg "An open space discussion in progress" %}
Open spaces at conferences are cool, especially when being reminded that the talks will be recorded (FOMO contained).


{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/the-dev-awakening.jpg "Ly-Jia Goldstein with 'The legend of Devs Awakening' " %}
We as developers have duty to [not harm and inform](http://ncrafts.io/speaker/Ly_Jia) non tech savvy.


{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/craftsmanship-father-to-son.jpg "Gilles Roustan with his grandfathers quote: 'A bad worker always complains about his tools.'" %}
I completely buy into the metaphore of software development as an artisanal trade and [the comparison with masonry](http://ncrafts.io/speaker/GillesRoustan).

<iframe style="height: 400px; width: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nytXq9Ql37g"></iframe>
<br/>Diversity in speakers makes tech conferences much more interesting. 
But diversity in attendees is lacking and a sad reflection of our industry.


{% img /assets/custom/img/blog/ncraft-2017/ncraft-closing-keynote.jpg "Alberto Brandolini with his quote: 'Software Development is a learning process. Working code is a side effect.'" %}
Software development is a [life of learning](http://ncrafts.io/speaker/ziobrando) and that's why we chose to code.
