A few days ago I completed five months as part of the Codurance team in Spain. It has 
all happened very fast because it's been intense, innovative, constructive, and very 
beautiful.

Codurance is growing and today I can affirm without fear of being wrong that being part 
of the company at this stage is one of the best professional challenges I have faced. There 
are several reasons for that conclusion; some of them can be approached from a more objective 
point of view, and some I do want to feel them from an emotional point of view. We are complex 
human beings and I think there are very subtle sensations that, sometimes, are the ones that 
make me get out of bed every morning and say: “let's go for another day and let's go sharp!”

## Feedback Culture
I have been able to verify how the feedback is part of our DNA, it is not just a claim on our 
website. We ask for feedback from our customers, those who are still potential customers, those 
who approach Codurance in selection processes, we ask for feedback from each other, we do it with 
our suppliers. We have a statement that is “help me improve, give me feedback!” We like to be 
consistent and aligned with this imperative need for continuous improvement that is an essential 
part of our culture.

In this sense, we also work on the processes to give and receive feedback, because the message 
and how it’s delivered is as important as the way it is received. 

## A new and peculiar environment
The first days at Codurance I understood 20% (being very optimistic) of the words, terms, and 
concepts I heard around me. I come from a marketing and communication background, and changing 
the registry (and more to one as technical as Codurance), requires a period of adaptation. I 
have to admit that this process is still underway, and thanks to my colleagues I’m still discovering 
new (very new) concepts, and really I love that. Luckily, they have a lot of patience, and it 
comforts me to think that if I could become familiar with an airline's operations language, I can 
come to understand this new language.

## Involvement with the community
Part of my role is to continue strengthening the active role that Codurance Spain has in the community 
of technical professionals in Barcelona. It is absolutely revealing to see the implication and the 
strong feeling of belonging that there are in this type of community. If anything is clear in Codurance 
it is that contributing our grain of sand to the community is part of our desires and is one of our 
objectives that motivates us.

One of the first actions has been to facilitate Codurance's facilities and resources so that the Global 
Day Coderetreat takes place in our offices, both in London and in Barcelona. We have worked hard so that 
those who have signed up for this special day would have a good reception in our offices and leave this 
retreat feeling satisfied and part of the community. That fills us with pride and satisfaction.

## Work with UK
This point is being fantastic, one of the most fascinating challenges this month. We work fully 
aligned and in real-time within our three offices of Codurance: London, Manchester, and Barcelona. 
It is not something we say on paper because it looks good at the brand level, it is a reality. 
My day to day is spent talking with Nichole, ​​David, and Angus, three of the colleagues who dedicate 
part of their work to issues related to the communication and marketing of the brand. If this 
workflows can be carried out is only possible if the communication channel and the availability 
of the partners is flawless. Thank you for your help in these first months, colleagues.

So, if you are reading this post and you think Codurance can be your new professional home, I encourage 
you to submit your application. We are in the process of hiring and we need developers. If you like 
challenges and you’re willing to offer your best, we are waiting for you. Craft at heart!
