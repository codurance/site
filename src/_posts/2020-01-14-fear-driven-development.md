On the internet there are a few different perspectives on Fear Driven Development (FDD). The
perspective I want to focus on here is below:

> The impact of fear on decision making whilst one is making software changes to a system.

Close your eyes and imagine someone looking at some code on a computer screen, they need to make
a change to that code. They then do something you would not expect, and you want to ask them why
they chose to make that decision (you can't, because they are in your imagination). This decision
was not driven by rational thinking, it was driven by something far worse. That is where we will
focus our attention in this article. The code.
