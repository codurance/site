On the internet there are a few different perspectives on Fear Driven Development (FDD). The
perspective I want to focus on here is below:

> The impact of fear on decision making whilst one is making software changes to a system.

Close your eyes and imagine someone looking at some code on a computer screen, they need to make
a change to that code. They then do something you would not expect, and you want to ask them why
they chose to make that decision (you can't, because they are in your imagination). This decision
was not driven by rational thinking, it was driven by something far worse. That is where we will
focus our attention in this article. The code. 

## Where the fear starts
FDD is alluded to [in the C2 wiki](https://wiki.c2.com/?FearDrivenDevelopment) as "maintaining the
code is hard because you don't know what unintended effects your changes have" in reference to
what is known as "legacy code". Let's start there and define what legacy code is:

> Code that you are afraid to change 

Nice and simple right? That definition is simple, and deliberately so. The focus of this post is not
to define what legacy code is.

In another post by [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/FearDrivenDevelopmentFDD.aspx)
there are descriptions of FDD pertaining to organisational fear and the fear of losing your job. 
However, we will focus our attention on the small section at the bottom about changing code.

So where does this fear start? Well, it could be some of the
following:

* unfamiliar with codebase
* new to the team (and don't want to screw this up)
* lack of context of what needs to be done
* pressure from others on this change (e.g. management)

Let's take a closer look at each of these, adding some more context.

### Unfamiliar with codebase
### New to the team
### Lack of context
### Pressure from others

## Append-only programming

## Copy and paste programming

## Tunnel-vision programming
