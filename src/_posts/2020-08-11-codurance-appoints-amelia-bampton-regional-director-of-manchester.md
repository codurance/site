We recently caught up with our new Regional Director of Codurance Manchester, Amelia Bampton, to find out more about her past and future plans at Codurance.

**Q: Hi Amelia, Welcome to Codurance, tell us a little bit about yourself** 

A: I’ve worked in software delivery for over 15 years, starting as a Business Analyst for a large consultancy, then taking various roles, such as Business Analyst, Project & Delivery Manager, and Portfolio Manager. I have worked for both in-house technology teams and also consultancies, which has exposed me to many industries, including Telecom, Retail, Health, Public Sector, and Automotive. Working in consultancy has also meant that I have worked with a range of technologies and delivery methodologies, including Java, Cloud, DevOps, XP, Agile; Scrum and Kanban, which is great as I am always gaining experience on how to make software delivery more effective.

I have also spent a good deal of time during my career working in in-house technology teams. Where it’s been great to build a relationship with the customer base and continually look to build out their experience and ease of use of the technology systems provided by the company.  These roles also helped me build out my understanding and appreciation for the ways of working and processes that surround the starting off and delivery of projects for large corporates. Which now places me in a good position, as I have an awareness of the financial processes and governance that need to be met to start and deliver projects.

**Q: Great thanks for the intro, so what will you be doing in the role of Regional Director for Manchester?**

A: I’m excited about my role at Codurance, I can now bring my two passions together, my love of great tech and my love for Manchester (anyone who meets me will know of my love for all things Manchester)! I have lived and worked in and around Manchester for nearly all of my career and I feel grateful it is the city where I do both. I have worked for several large companies in the area and really enjoy the community feel that the technology network has here.

My new role will see me connecting local companies to our great Codurance services. I’m lucky as there is a knowledgeable and experienced team in the Codurance Manchester office, so I’m excited to work with them and develop and grow the talent we have and the great culture too. We will be reaching out to local companies who are needing a partner to help with their technology solutions. The team are also keen to keep up the good work of the Manchester-based events and move them to a virtual meet-up, so they can continue to grow the tech community that they have built in the area.

I’m looking forward to getting out into the Manchester business community, attending and hosting events. I enjoy connecting with previous colleagues and meeting new people in the tech community too. Codurance is a great company and I can’t wait to start partnering with Manchester companies to help them solve their current business problems and help their companies grow. Spreading the word about Codurance and attracting talent to grow our community will also be a key part of my role.

**Q: So what made you Join Codurance?**

A: There were a few things that helped me decide that Codurance was the right place for me. I’m passionate about delivering great tech and wanting to ensure that the technical solutions being built add value to whoever their customer base is. Knowing how important quality and software craftsmanship is to the company and is central to all their engagements was really important to me. 

The values of the company of openness and transparency, result in a culture, where everyone is really friendly and generous with their time. Being part of a team with these values means I feel very at home here. Loving what you do and feeling energised by your career is important for me and I definitely get these positive feelings from everyone I’ve met at Codurance.

The role itself gives me the opportunity to work with more people across the North West. I enjoy meeting new people and finding out about the companies they work for, so I felt this was the right time, to build on my delivery skills and use these in a wider role. Where I can take my love for meeting new people, finding out about their companies current business and technology aspirations and combine these with my delivery skillset to find a good technology partnership fit.

**Q: That sounds great! So what are your plans for Manchester?**

A: Mine and the team's primary focus right now is spreading the word about Codurance in and around Manchester, and connecting with companies who need a partner to help them achieve their technology goals. 

The next few years are really exciting for Codurance as we continue to grow in Manchester. The City is seeing lots of growth too, with it being a hive of new start-ups, scale-ups, and also more and more large corporates moving to the area. I think the combination of this means we have a really exciting, but busy few years to come and I can’t wait to be part of it!
