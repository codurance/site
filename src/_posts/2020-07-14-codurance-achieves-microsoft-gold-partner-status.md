Codurance today announced that it has attained a Gold Application Development competency - the highest status in the Microsoft Partner Network, demonstrating outstanding performance, industry-leading ability to develop cloud-based enterprise solutions and exceptional levels of expertise with the Microsoft software platform.

Codurance’s team has decades of deep project experience in Microsoft technologies spanning application development, data analytics and cloud solutions built on Azure.

To earn the Gold competency, Codurance had to successfully validate its level of technology expertise and certify the required number of engineers in the latest Microsoft technology stack. The company has also recently gained the Silver Data Analytics competency, further demonstrating the breadth and depth of knowledge and support Codurance can service on client engagements.

Gaining these competencies demonstrates our commitment to technical excellence and reassures clients that they will get the very best and latest technical advice and guidance when evaluating, building and adopting new technologies to meet enterprise business needs.

Becoming a best in class provider within the global Microsoft Partner Network will enable Codurance to strengthen its capabilities to showcase leadership in the marketplace on the latest technology, to better serve customers (for example through easier access to Microsoft software and experts) and to easily connect with one of the most active, diverse networks in the world. It will also allow us to drive greater collaboration with Microsoft’s technical and commercial teams and the global partner ecosystem, bringing huge opportunities to help even more clients accelerate their transformation to the cloud and modern enterprise solutions.
