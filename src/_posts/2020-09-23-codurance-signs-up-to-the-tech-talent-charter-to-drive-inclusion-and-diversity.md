Codurance is pleased to announce that it has become a signatory of the Tech Talent Charter (TTC), a not-for-profit organisation with a mission to drive greater equality in UK Tech and reduce the widening technology skills gap. The TTC provides a community and platform of content and tools to support its members’ inclusion & diversity initiatives and create new opportunities for attracting and retaining diverse talent. They also produce an annual benchmarking report using data from their members tracking diversity in technology across the UK.

>“We are thrilled to be joining the Tech Talent Charter. Our goals at Codurance include delivering valuable software for our clients and helping to sustain better ways of working through skills transfer and positive cultural change. We also want to contribute to this positive change through measures that drive inclusion and lodiversity at Codurance and within the UK tech sector, and are confident that joining the TTC will help us achieve that.” 

<b> Anne-Marie Mendonça, Head of People & Talent at Codurance and Tech Talent Charter Senior Signatory</b>

Codurance will now be able to use the TTC’s Open Playbook, a comprehensive online resource providing ideas, signposts, reports and templates covering everything related to improving hiring processes, culture, retraining, returners and more. Moreover, there will be regular member-only events that provide valuable insights and shared success stories with other signatories throughout the year. We’ll also be able to benchmark our own progress against the wider UK tech community with access to the annual report.

This all feeds into Codurance’s ongoing strategic commitment to ensuring the company is the best place to work for anyone that shares our values of learning, transparency, autonomy and craftsmanship, regardless of their protected characteristics or background. 

We fully embrace diversity at Codurance and know there is a proven direct link between having a diverse team that feels supported and included with increased project success and staff happiness and retention. 

We already have a number of initiatives in place that support inclusive hiring and through our Codurance Academy we provide a fantastic opportunity for anyone with the prerequisite skills to take their next step to become a Codurance Craftsperson-In-training with our 3-month paid programme.

Codurance has offices in London, Manchester and Barcelona. Our people support inclusion & diversity in tech communities in the UK and Spain and will continue to provide opportunities for people in underrepresented groups through events, initiatives and workshops.

Through the support of the TTC, we will continue to look at ways of improving our culture and hiring process and share our learnings with other members to play our part in improving the overall pipeline of talent in UK Tech.
