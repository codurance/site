We are very happy to announce that we have opened a new office in Barcelona. 

## Why Barcelona?

Barcelona has a vibrant [Software Craftsmanship community](http://www.meetup.com/Barcelona-Software-Craftsmanship/) which is very aligned to our values at Codurance. We hope to provide a home for some of the talented developers who make this community so great. 

We see Barcelona as an upcoming city when it comes to Agile and Software Craftsmanship, and quite a few companies are keen to work with us.

Barcelona is a great city and a place where many of us from Codurance would love to be. We think that London and Barcelona are some of the best cities in Europe to work and live. We envisage a close connection between the two offices. The many direct flights between London and Barcelona every day will make it easy for our people to collaborate across the two cities. 

## What’s next?

We are looking for talented software craftsmen and craftswomen to join us in Barcelona. Once they join us, we would love to have them spending some time with us in London to meet the whole team. 

If you are a developer and would like to join us, please check our [careers page](https://codurance.es/careers/) and drop us a line. If you would like to find out more about our services then have a look [here](https://codurance.es/services).
