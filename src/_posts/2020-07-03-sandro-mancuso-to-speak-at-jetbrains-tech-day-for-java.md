Codurance’s Co-Founder Sandro Mancuso will deliver a talk on “Software Modernisation” as part of JetBrains’ Global Technology Day for Java event on Friday, July 10th 2020. The online conference will feature leading voices from the Java community sharing their expertise on Modern Java, Frameworks, Testing, Concurrent Garbage Collectors, Contributing to OSS, and much more.  

This year’s event is even more special as Java celebrates its 25th birthday! Attendees will be able to share in the celebrations whilst boosting their skills and creativity around all things Java and JetBrains tools.
