As Skills Matter restarts its operations, we are excited to announce that we will be partnering with Skills Matter at a much deeper level. Together we will provide a more holistic offering combining strategic consultancy, software delivery, and training with leading experts. We will also work together to nurture technical communities supporting and running meet-ups and events together.

Codurance and Skills Matter have a long history of collaboration both commercially and in our community work. We feel that, in some part, we owe our genesis to Skills Matterâ€”they were the home for the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/" target="_blank">London Software Craftsmanship Community</a> for many years.

Since our very beginning, we have pursued a mission to help individuals and businesses continually improve their software craft. The partnership with Skills Matter will have a wider and deeper impact in our industry. We feel this will strengthen our ability to create a lasting positive impact on our clients and within the software development community.
