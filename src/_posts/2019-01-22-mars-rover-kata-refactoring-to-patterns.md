This article is an account of how I learned to apply patterns. It condenses concepts from the first two weeks of the apprenticeship program by making use of a programming kata.

A kata is an exercise where you're given a specific set of rules and it can get as specific as having an isolated domain problem. This can be used to learn the useful concepts needed solving problems within that domain. Doing it repeatedly and attempting a different solution each time leads to a better understanding of how to solve that set of problems.

In this article I&#39;m going to go through the Mars Rover kata and how I used it kata to learn both classic test-driven development together with how to refactor things and also how to apply the Command and State design patterns. Applying patterns to such a simple problem is over-engineering. However, this provides a guide for learning about refactoring and to train a sense of where they can be applied it's a very good exercise.

I provide the commits following the red-green-refactor pattern as it&#39;s like the &quot;making of&quot; part of a movie. The metaphor of film editing has a good resemblance with the one of editing code. It can be useful to know about the different steps of the creative process than to just watch the end result if one&#39;s purpose is to learn about development process.

In part, it is inspired by two books, TDD By Example by Kent Beck and 4 Rules of Simple Design by Corey Haines.

In TDD by Example, Kent Beck walks the reader through a detailed description of the benefits and decision-making test by test, along with some design principles. He suggests making a to-do list of the test cases as a pointer towards what one wants to achieve. This illustrates the point of always having a plan and avoiding programming by coincidence. This book also teaches what tests to pick and which way to go depending on what the limits of the design are along the way. It also introduces the Value Object design pattern, as well as the red-green-refactor technique.

In 4 Rules of Simple Design, Corey Haines makes the distinction between testing for state and testing for behavior, as well as how tests drive design and the code design feeds back into how we further write the tests.

#Business rules and the first tests

One way to look at business rules is to split them in two categories: indicative, and optative. This is an idea from [Richard Wild](https://codurance.com/publications/author/richard-wild/), a fellow Codurance craftsman.

Indicative rules are specifications that don&#39;t change or are easy to change, like the dead and alive state for a cell in the Conway&#39;s Game of Life, or the world has a size in the case of Mars Rover.

Optative rules are the ones that change, and often contain &quot;if&quot; and &quot;should&quot; in the content of their formulation. These are the rules that we need to code for and that influence our design. The order in which one gets implemented also influences how we would design things. Depending on the kata it&#39;s often best to pick the simplest rule and start from there, especially when other rules depend on other rules to be implemented first. In other cases picking a different rule will lead to a different, and often original implementation of the exercise.

In the case of the this kata the indicative rules are the ones about the world size, as well as the number of commands. The optative rules are around the commands themselves.

<details>
  <summary>After a bit of debate we chose to test that the rover stays in the same position given an empty command. This sets the stage for the next test, as we decided to design changing the coordinate before designing the turning algorithm.
</summary>

```diff
public class MarsRover {
  public MarsRover(int x, int y, String cardinal) {}
  public String execute(String commands) {
    return null;
  }
}
```
```diff

public class MarsRoverShould {
  @Test
  void return_initial_position_of_rover_without_any_command() {
    final String emptyCommand = "";

    assertThat(new MarsRover(1,2,"N").execute(emptyCommand)
    is("1 2 N"));
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Following TPP we return a literal as the simplest step to make the test pass.</summary>

```diff
  public String execute(String commands) {
-    return null;
+    return "1 2 N";
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>We changed to a parameterized test as we&#39;re going to have very similar test cases and our intent would be more explicit.</summary>

```diff

- @Test
-  void return_initial_position_of_rover_without_any_command() {
+  @ParameterizedTest
+  @CsvSource({"1, 2, N, '1 2 N'"})
+  void return_initial_position_of_rover_without_any_command(int initialX, int initialY, String initialCardinal, String expectedCoordinate) {
    final String emptyCommand = "";
-    assertThat(new MarsRover(1,2,"N").execute(emptyCommand), CoreMatchers.is("1 2 N"));
+    assertThat(new MarsRover(initialX, initialY, initialCardinal).execute(emptyCommand), CoreMatchers.is(expectedCoordinate));
  }
```

</details>

<details> <summary>Decided that the simplest thing, and one that would take a bigger leap would be to return a variable. After that we also extracted the formatting of the String being displayed and kept it consistent with the business rules. We also decided the initial position would be injected in the constructor. </summary>

```diff

  @ParameterizedTest

    "1, 2, N, '1 2 N'",
    "1, 3, N, '1 3 N'"
  })

    int initialX, int initialY, String initialCardinal,
    String expectedCoordinate) {

    final String emptyCommand = "";
    final MarsRover rover = new MarsRover(initialX, initialY, initialCardinal);

    final String actualCoordinate = rover.execute(emptyCommand);

    assertThat(new MarsRover(initialX, initialY, initialCardinal).execute(emptyCommand), CoreMatchers.is(expectedCoordinate));
    assertThat(actualCoordinate, CoreMatchers.is(expectedCoordinate));
  }

```

  }

  public String execute(String commands) {

+    return formatCoordinate();
  }

  }
}

# Coding towards the first abstraction

At this point one can go either to start building the turning algorithm or the moving algorithm. We decided to go with the moving. Once we got that going the next dilemma was to either start wrapping around the world, the &quot;rainy&quot; path where we would need to start designing for an edge case or the &quot;happy&quot; path, to move in other directions.

We decided for the happy path. It introduces some duplication. That points to us that we could use an abstraction for moving the rover. In a larger context this is relevant for the user story one implements. Do we implement for something that is more &quot;deliverable&quot; and works straight away. This is something of immediate use to a product owner or the business. Going for the edge case would be making things more robust. So one important thing to take into account in the real-world is what the business needs at the moment and prioritize which feature gets implemented first.

</details>  
  
At this point we have a larger class that needs refactoring. So the decision at this point is whether one has enough for an abstraction for the moving logic or to continue in order to discover another pattern in the code. We decided to continue with implementing the turning logic as we could always come back at abstracting the moving into class that would know by itself which way to move.

# Refactoring to State and Command patterns
We decided to abstract the Cardinal switching details in a self contained class. Delegating a call to its own right() and left() methods would make use of the State pattern and lets the cardinal manage the switching. In a way looks like a water molecule that has one big atom in the middle and two neighboring ones to its left and right. Naming the Cardinal State subtype methods to left() and right() distances the implementation from turning and makes it more reusable in another context. It makes the switch go away, and also puts the responsibility of switching state to the cardinal and not to the rover. The cognitive load of the class is lesser because before the refactoring the Rover class had to know about all the mappings and now the mappings are self-contained.

And that&#39;s it, condensing the concepts learned in the first two weeks of apprenticeship using the Mars Rover kata.

It was done over a few pair programming sessions by Simion Iulian Belea and [Sam Davies](https://codurance.com/publications/author/sam-davies/).
