Another great kata for honing your TDD fundamentals. This is another classic, usually attempted as a follow-on from FizzBuzz and normally considered a slight step up in difficulty because of the slightly more complicated rules. In practice, most developers can hold an entire solution to FizzBuzz in their working memory, but the Leap Year algorithm is a greater cognitive load, so it's normally not possible in one go.
