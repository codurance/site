  role: Software Craftsman
  fullDescription:
    <p>Rob discovered his passion for software development at university. Shortly after landing his first job and being exposed to 'real world' projects, he discovered his passion for <em>well crafted</em> software.</p>
    <p>Witnessing the frustration and inertia brought about by code that displayed the scars of corner-cutting and carelessness made him realise the importance of keeping the code clean. In his opinion, since software is eating the world, organisations that disregard the economics of flexible, robust software will ultimately fail.</p>
    <p>To that end it's since been his goal to constantly improve himself as a software developer. Rob enjoys practising katas, working on open-source projects and being involved with the London Software Craftsmanship Community. He was a co-founder of the open-source Android MVVM framework 'Robobinding'.</p>

  fullDescription:
    <p>Andrew has a background in Chemistry. As a teenager, he tried programming a few times, but he couldn't get his head round it. He didn't attempt coding again until his mid-twenties, after his PhD supervisor suggested it would be simpler to model a bank of froth flotation cells in C than in Excel. He tried that, but Notepad, a borrowed ANSI C reference book and a C compiler weren't much better. However, at that point, Microsoft released Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition and that is when Andrew discovered VB.NET and IntelliSense. Hallelujah! And with that, the coding bug caught hold and Andrew decided he didn't want to be a lab rat anymore.</p>
    <p>Andrew then went on to work on many varied things. From working on the Gassco New PMS system, bringing Norwegian gas to the UK and continental Europe, to building and maintaing the Amnesty International .org website, defending human rights across the world.</p>
    <p>When Andrew isn't in front of a computer, he spends his time with his family. He recently started to learn Karate with his eldest son. And hes a huge fan of F1.</p>

    <p>Ivan’s background starts with a degree in Economics, however, this was never his passion. Of all Economics subjects, he enjoyed Behavioural Economics where working with people was essential. Luckily, his path led him to a second degree in Software Development where he was finally able to fully dedicate his time to what he is most passionate about.</p>
    <p>His professional career started in the utility sector where he learned about the full software lifecycle. He was involved in customer interaction, requirements gathering, software deployment, configuration, Linux administration and security, and in writing small pieces of software to support internal processes.</p>
    <p>Ivan loves learning about and implementing new technologies and software engineering paradigms. He strongly believes that technology should not be created or used just for the sake of the technology itself. While picking up and learning about new software is extremely exciting, the aim of the engineer should be to improve people’s lives and him or herself through his craft. Improvement is more beneficial, fun and easier when done with other people, teamwork is key.</p>
    <p>In his free time, Ivan enjoys sports (especially basketball) and trying new types of food. He is also a big fan of anime and fantasy books.</p>

    <p>Before starting as a software developer Riccardo worked in the music industry, as a musician at first and then as an artist manager and consultant in both Italy and the UK.
    <p>He later gained some experience working with JVM based languages and Pivotal’s tech stack, across different systems from legacy monoliths to cloud based microservices. This gave him the opportunity to observe in different circumstances how often the success of a software product can be jeopardised by some poor choices in software design as well as over-engineered architectures or lack of communication and feedback inside the organisations. Therefore he ended up becoming a fiery sponsor of the Software Craftsmanship movement and a TDD, Extreme Programming and Clean Code advocate.</p>
    <p>Within the last few years, his continuous learning approach gave him the opportunity to grow quickly - sharing his learning and absorbing technical knowledge from his fellow colleagues, adopting a collaborative attitude and always remaining curious and inquisitive.</p>
    <p>He inherited from his past experience, in other contexts, a set of soft skills such as a natural ability to comprehend the business domain and the business needs, negotiate solutions, understand different perspectives or mitigate contrasts.</p>

    <p>Edward has come from a large enterprise company, having worked on a complex cloud-based micro-service application for a number of years. This environment taught him a lot about these kinds of distibuted applications as well as how to develop enterprise projects.</p>
    <p>However, as is not un-common for companies such as these, he soon found that the environment he was working in was frustrating in a number of ways. Whether it was due to the demands of documentation and other obstacles, or the lack of drive and aptitude from some of his colleagues, he needed to find a role that fit better with his outlook on learning and personal development. So after discovering Codurance and finding out about their ethos of craftsmanship, the idea of working for Codurance really appealed to him. And now he has come through the apprenticeship program, which was one of the most valuable learning experiences of his life</p>
    <p>In his free time, Edward goes rock-climbing, plays chess and plays some video games, one of them being a sim racing game, in which he participates in competitive races every Sunday.

  role: Software Craftsman
  fullDescription:
    <p>Jocelyn started to get curious about programming at the age of 13 whilst using IRC clients, which was running a quiz game and allowed him to explore the scripts behind the game. It was only during his University studies that he discovered how facinating programming was which lead him to graduate with a Masters degree in Distributed Systems.</p>
    <p>Coming from a musical background in parallel, he knows the importance of continous practice and how rewarding it is in the long run.</p>
    <p>He first heard about eXtreme Programming during his studies and after a few years he discovered how to use the practice of TDD which was a revelation of what programming means for him. Having understood the power of fundamental principles in software development, he started to fill up his e-book reader library.</p>
    <p>He's always looking for developing high quality software in order to make developers and users life easier.</p>
    <p>Outside of work he enjoys the vast variety of craft beers, going out in nice weather to cycle around the city, playing a bit of table tennis and learning new languages, human and programming.</p>
