  fullDescription:
    <p>Rob discovered his passion for software development at university. Shortly after landing his first job and being exposed to 'real world' projects, he discovered his passion for <em>well crafted</em> software.</p>
    <p>Witnessing the frustration and inertia brought about by code that displayed the scars of corner-cutting and carelessness made him realise the importance of keeping the code clean. In his opinion, since software is eating the world, organisations that disregard the economics of flexible, robust software will ultimately fail.</p>
    <p>To that end it's since been his goal to constantly improve himself as a software developer. Rob enjoys practising katas, working on open-source projects and being involved with the London Software Craftsmanship Community. He was a co-founder of the open-source Android MVVM framework 'Robobinding'.</p>

  fullDescription:
    <p>Andrew has a background in Chemistry. As a teenager, he tried programming a few times, but he couldn't get his head round it. He didn't attempt coding again until his mid-twenties, after his PhD supervisor suggested it would be simpler to model a bank of froth flotation cells in C than in Excel. He tried that, but Notepad, a borrowed ANSI C reference book and a C compiler weren't much better. However, at that point, Microsoft released Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition and that is when Andrew discovered VB.NET and IntelliSense. Hallelujah! And with that, the coding bug caught hold and Andrew decided he didn't want to be a lab rat anymore.</p>
    <p>Andrew then went on to work on many varied things. From working on the Gassco New PMS system, bringing Norwegian gas to the UK and continental Europe, to building and maintaing the Amnesty International .org website, defending human rights across the world.</p>
    <p>When Andrew isn't in front of a computer, he spends his time with his family. He recently started to learn Karate with his eldest son. And hes a huge fan of F1.</p>

Luckily, his path led him to a second degree in Software Development where he was finally able to fully dedicate his time to what he is most passionate about.</p>
    <p>His professional career started in the utility sector where he learned about the full software lifecycle. He was involved in customer interaction, requirements gathering, software deployment, configuration, Linux administration and security, and in writing small pieces of software to support internal processes.</p>
    <p>Ivan loves learning about and implementing new technologies and software engineering paradigms. He strongly believes that technology should not be created or used just for the sake of the technology itself. While picking up and learning about new software is extremely exciting, the aim of the engineer should be to improve people’s lives and him or herself through his craft. Improvement is more beneficial, fun and easier when done with other people, teamwork is key.</p>
    <p>In his free time, Ivan enjoys sports (especially basketball) and trying new types of food. He is also a big fan of anime and fantasy books.</p>

  fullDescription:
    <p>Ade is someone who likes to experiment with things. He likes to try and do things in different ways if the normal approach does not seem to work out so well.</p>
    <p>His career as a QA Tester was mainly by coincidence as his first role after studying was in the area of testing, now he says it really suits him better. His attitude is that he enjoys finding faults with software so it can be made better, apparently that really gets him out of bed in the mornings.</p>
    <p>Outside of work he enjoys reading, travelling and generally having good food to eat. He likes to enjoy the finer things in life, given he wants to make the most out of it.</p>
