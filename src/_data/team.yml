    <p>Rob discovered his passion for software development at university. Shortly after landing his first job and being exposed to 'real world' projects, he discovered his passion for <em>well crafted</em> software.</p>
    <p>Witnessing the frustration and inertia brought about by code that displayed the scars of corner-cutting and carelessness made him realise the importance of keeping the code clean. In his opinion, since software is eating the world, organisations that disregard the economics of flexible, robust software will ultimately fail.</p>
    <p>To that end it's since been his goal to constantly improve himself as a software developer. Rob enjoys practising katas, working on open-source projects and being involved with the London Software Craftsmanship Community. He was a co-founder of the open-source Android MVVM framework 'Robobinding'.</p>

    <p>Ivan’s background starts with a degree in Economics, however, this was never his passion. Of all Economics subjects, he enjoyed Behavioural Economics where working with people was essential. Luckily, his path led him to a second degree in Software Development where he was finally able to fully dedicate his time to what he is most passionate about.</p>
    <p>His professional career started in the utility sector where he learned about the full software lifecycle. He was involved in customer interaction, requirements gathering, software deployment, configuration, Linux administration and security, and in writing small pieces of software to support internal processes.</p>
    <p>Ivan loves learning about and implementing new technologies and software engineering paradigms. He strongly believes that technology should not be created or used just for the sake of the technology itself. While picking up and learning about new software is extremely exciting, the aim of the engineer should be to improve people’s lives and him or herself through his craft. Improvement is more beneficial, fun and easier when done with other people, teamwork is key.</p>
    <p>In his free time, Ivan enjoys sports (especially basketball) and trying new types of food. He is also a big fan of anime and fantasy books.</p>

    <p>However, as is not un-common for companies such as these, he soon found that the environment he was working in was frustrating in a number of ways. Whether it was due to the demands of documentation and other obstacles, or the lack of drive and aptitude from some of his colleagues, he needed to find a role that fit better with his outlook on learning and personal development. So after discovering Codurance and finding out about their ethos of craftsmanship, the idea of working for Codurance really appealed to him. And now he has come through the apprenticeship program, which was one of the most valuable learning experiences of his life</p>
    <p>In his free time, Edward goes rock-climbing, plays chess and plays some video games, one of them being a sim racing game, in which he participates in competitive races every Sunday.

  fullDescription:
    <p>As he started in our industry, Florian was an idealist. He believed that because software was human-made it would be possible to do away with the inherent complexity of natural things and build it clear, understandable, maintainable. When he found out not everyone shared the same perspective, Software Craft, and the Software Craft Community, came to the rescue.</p>
    <p>Fast forward a couple of years, after having practiced TDD daily, turned many pieces of legacy code into prose, and converted originally reluctant people to the wonderful world of maintainable code, he realized that technical fluency was only one piece of the puzzle. Just as important, if not more, is the ability for a group of people to work together and collaborate constructively on a shared objective. He found great value in the practice of mindfulness, empathy and transparent communication.</p>
    <p>Lately, he is interested in figuring out how to best combine the technical and human sides of our work to deliver continuous business value and grow our engagement with the client.</p>
    <p>If you’re interested in knowing more, he is very approachable and always happy to have a quick chat.</p>
