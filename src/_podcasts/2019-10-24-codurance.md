It was finally time to talk with our co-founders [Mash](https://codurance.com/publications/author/mashooq-badar/) and [Sandro](https://codurance.com/publications/author/sandro-mancuso/) about Codurance. And one of our longest serving co-workers (and now Head of Professional Services), [Steve](https://codurance.com/publications/author/steve-lydford/), joins as well.
