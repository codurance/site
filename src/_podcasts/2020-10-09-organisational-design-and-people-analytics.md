Dr Laura Weis is Chief Strategy Officer at Satalia, a company that specialises in data science, artificial intelligence, optimisation, machine learning and organisational design. Laura's work involves helping organisations better understand their people, processes and culture to create solutions to improve their business at any level.

In this episode of Codurance Talks, Laura talks to José Huerta, MD of Codurance Spain and himself an expert on organisational change management, about the fascinating domain of organisational design and social network analysis and its impact in the workplace.

During the conversation Laura and José discuss:

-   How to define what organisational design and network analysis is.

-   Why it is becoming increasingly relevant in decentralised, knowledge-based organisations.

-   The challenges of modern working practices, especially accelerated by Covid-19 restrictions.

-   The methods and tools that can be used to explore organisational situations and the application of social network analysis.

-   The art of understanding the insights and making data actionable.

-   A use case discussion based on Diversity & Inclusion - how can inclusion be measured in an organisation? How to understand if a D&I initiative has been effective?

-   The role of influencers on an organization's culture.

-   How to get started with your own program for change and improvement using these methods.
