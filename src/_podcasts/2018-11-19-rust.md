Our first outside guest (well, kind of cheating as he was until recently a colleague at Codurance): [Cyryl PÅ‚otnicki](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/cyplo). A person that loves Rust and has spread the love within Codurance for this language. [Liam Griffin-Jowett](https://codurance.com/publications/author/liam-griffin-jowett/) and [Sam Davies](https://codurance.com/publications/author/sam-davies/) help in delivering the content.
