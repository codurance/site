## Run the tests

- Build the docker-compose-override site image with...
  - `docker-compose -f docker-compose.override.yml build`
- You only need to do that once. Now you can run the tests quickly & easily with...
  - `docker-compose -f docker-compose.override.yml run site bundle exec rspec`

## Setup the ~development~ writing environment

You can serve the site through [docker](#building-if-you-like-docker) or [natively](#building-if-you-like-ruby) on your machine.

### Building if you like Docker

#### TL;DR

1. [Install docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
1. [Install docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (on Mac and Windows it comes with docker)

Build image:

`docker-compose build`

Run container in a watch and auto rebuild mode:

`docker-compose up`

Stop container:

`docker-compose stop`

Destroy container:

`docker-compose down`

##### Detailed docker commands

You need to do this only once - this builds the image with all the dependencies inside.
If you change the project dependencies (Gemfile) then rebuild the image again.

`docker-compose build`

Run this to run the container with only the latest posts (faster rebuild).
Source files are mounted inside the container from your host machine.
Site will be rebuilt automatically when you change the source code.

`docker-compose up`

Open site:

`localhost:4000`

Run this if you want all posts (slower rebuild):

`docker-compose run --service-ports site rake serve`

If you want to start the container with a different command use:

`docker-compose run --service-ports site <command>`

Destroy the container and all volumes for this project.
Run this if your container is broken.

`docker-compose down`

##### Notes for Windows users

As docker "18.06.0-ce-win72 (19098)", you need to setup COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS environment variable and restart the docker service before running `docker-compose build`:

```bash
SET COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1
net stop com.docker.service
net start com.docker.service
```

Then you can run `docker-compose build`

Starting the container with `docker-compose up` doesnt seem to work but starting it with `docker run -p 4000:4000 -d <imageid>` does, the downside
is that you will have to run `docker-compose build`, `docker images` and `docker run -p 4000:4000 -d <imageid>` to check each update you make.
Note (Jorge): `docker-compose up` works for me, but there is no automated refresh

### Building if you like ruby

Install GSL (GNU Scientific Library) for Ruby:

- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install libgsl0-dev`
- Fedora/SuSE: `yum install gsl-devel`
- Gentoo: `emerge sci-libs/gsl`
- OS X: `brew install gsl`

Install [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io/), Ruby and Bundler:

- `rvm install ruby`
- `rvm use ruby`
- `gem install bundler`

Now run Bundler and serve the site locally:

- `bundle install`
- `rake servequick`\*

The site should now be running on http://localhost:4000

_\*`rake serve_quicker` is also available which rebuilds faster by only rebuilding the EN language website._

In case of problems, refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting).

## Flight Rules

### Adding a post

To do a post in the website you need to follow the following guidelines:

1. Add a file with the following name format `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` in `src/_posts`. the name of the file will also
   be the url of the post. `eg. https://url.com/YYYY/MM/DD/name-of-post`

2. Create a folder with the same name in `src/assets/custom/img/blog` where your images will be stored

3. The following metadata is needed for technical and SEO purposes.

- `author: John Doe` (Same name on the `team.yml` so we can redirect to all your posts)
- `date:` (format YYYY-MMM-DD 00:00:00)
- `layout: post`
- `asset-type: post`
- `title` this is the displayed title on the website
- `abstract` this is a subtitle that is displayed only in the post page, try to make is concise.
- `description` this is needed for sharing purposes, do a quick summary of what is the post about
- `image: src:` this is the banner's picture path
- `tags` add the tags that you feel go according to the post, is important that you don't repeat other tags with different
  spelling, to check the tags that exist you can run the python script `src/list-tags.py`.

You can see an example here:

```
---
author: John Doe
layout: post
asset-type: post
title: This is the title of my post
date: 2020-02-19 00:00:00
description: This is the description of the example post, it will appear when someone share's it.
image:
    src: /assets/custom/img/blog/2020-02-19-example-post/banner.png

abstract: Small subtitle under the title in the post
tags:
    - life at codurance
    - another tag
    - yet another
---
```

### Adding links in your post

Links can be added to a post in a couple of ways. The preference is to make sure that `target="_blank"` is used so that any links open in a new browser tab and do not take the user away from the blog post or the website.

To use `target="_blank"` the only currently supported by our Jekyll version is to include links as HTML in the markdown. So for example -

```
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link Example</a>
```

### Adding a video to the publications

- Add an md file to the folder: `videos/_posts` (You can use older videos post as a template)
- Do not forget the attribute `video-url`, for youtube videos, use following format: `https://www.youtube.com/embed/<video-id>`
- Add an image to the video, for youtube videos, make a screenshot [here](http://youtubescreenshot.com/), the image is used on the home page and the carousel. The image is to be saved under `/assets/custom/img/videos/`

## Previewing changes for a pull request

![illustration of how to go the site preview](docs/assets/how-to-go-to-site-preview.png)

We have a bot that makes a preview of the site for every branch that you create.

If you don't have a PR, you can just replace the branch name in the link below:

`http://codurance-site-pr.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/site-[branch-name]`

## Troubleshooting

### Problem with ruby dependencies in docker

If after a pull you can't get docker compose to work and it's complaining about `Bundler::GemNotFound` or similar.

This probably means that the docker image has been updated and you local machines "latest" is not in fact the latest.

This can be fixed with:

```bash
docker system prune -a
```

After this the next docker operation will download the correct image.

### Problem with files permissions in docker (linux)

When using `selinux` (e.g. on Fedora) you may encounter an error that a mounted file cannot be accessed from a docker container.

Example error:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
Starting site_site_1 ... done
site_1  | /usr/local/bundle/gems/bundler-1.16.6/lib/bundler/definition.rb:33:in `build': /usr/local/src/Gemfile not found (Bundler::GemfileNotFound)
```

Problem is with permissions for mounted files and folders.
To check the files permissions inside container run:

```bash
$ docker-compose run site ls -la
-??????????  ? ?    ?        ?            ? Gemfile
-??????????  ? ?    ?        ?            ? Rakefile
-rw-rw-r--.  1 root root  6269 Jun 28 13:07 README.md
```

If you see questions marks like in the example above for the mounted files it could mean that selinux prohibits docker from accessing them from your disk.

To fix this problem change selinux policies for the whole project:

`sudo chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t site/`

### Header files for ruby not found

This problem happens with Linux systems:

`header files for ruby at /usr/lib/ruby/include/ruby.h not found`

in case `ruby-dev` package is not installed:

`sudo apt-get install ruby-dev`

### extconf.rb failed

`zlib` is necessary for building `libxml2`:

`sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev`

### Gem problems

If other things don't make sense - [follow this guide to clear out your cached gems and start the process again](https://coderwall.com/p/x3z2ag/cleanup-rvm)

### Problems with installation of ffi gem on MacOS

To install ffi gem in the newer versions of MacOS you need install Xcode tool first. After restarting your terminal, the following command need to be executed:

`brew install libtool automake autoconf`

### CI docker images preparation

There are two images used to build and deploy the application. The necessary commands to update them is here. Be aware that if you do it using the tag latest it will affect the master branch at the moment

```bash
docker build --file=Dockerfile_build_base -t codurance/website_build_base:latest .
docker push codurance/website_build_base:latest
```

```bash
docker build --file=Dockerfile_deployment_base -t codurance/website_deployment_base:latest .
docker push codurance/website_deployment_base:latest
```

## Backstopjs

We have some documentation for backstop [here](tools/snapshots/README.md)

Backstopjs can be used to regression test websites. It does this by capturing screenshots of the two sites and comparing them.
This is especially useful if you are refactoring css.

See the linked documents to show how to install.

Once installed here are the commands to make it work:

```
backstop reference
backstop test
```

The first captures a snapshot of the reference site (currently set to https://codurance.com)
The second runs it against the local version of the site (locahost:4000) and compares the differences.

## Feature Toggles

We are using [toggles.yml](src/_data/toggles.yml) to set toggles "on" or "off".

```yml
feature-my-feature: "on"
feature-some-other-feature: "off"
```

The simpliest use of toggles would be a simple conditional:

```liquid
{% if site.data.toggles.my-feature == 'on' %}
  {% include my-component.html %}
{% endif %}
```

### Tidy up

It should go without saying that once a feature has been switched on in production and is considered stable the toggle should be removed from the codebase.
