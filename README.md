# [Codurance Web Site](https://codurance.com/)

## Setup the <del>development</del> writing environment 

You can serve the site through [docker](#installing-if-you-like-docker) or [natively](#installing-if-you-like-ruby) on your machine.

### Installing if you like Docker

##### TL;DR
1. [install docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
- `docker build --tag codurance-site:local -f ./Dockerfile-local .`
- ``docker run -i -t -v `pwd`:/site -p 4000:4000 codurance-site:local``

##### More details

You need to execute the following command to prepare an image and run a container:

```
# you need to do this only once - this builds the container with all the dependencies for running the site
docker build --tag codurance-site:local -f ./Dockerfile-local .
```
```
# you need to run this every time you want to stand up the local server - it should watch for changes in the local files automatically though
docker run -i -t -v `pwd`:/site -p 4000:4000 codurance-site:local 
```

If you want to run a different rake target on the container start use:

```
docker run -i -t -v `pwd`:/site -p 4000:4000 -e RAKE_TARGET="your_target" codurance-site:local
```

### Installing if you like ruby

1. install rvm https://rvm.io/
- `rvm install ruby`
- `rvm use ruby`
- `gem install bundler`
- `bundle install`


run locally:

1. `bundle exec rake servequick`

## Flight Rules

### Adding a post

  * Remember to add the tag `asset-type: post` to the post metadata

### Adding an abstract to a post

  * See [Jenkins example post](/site/blob/master/_posts/2014-10-03-guide-to-deploying-artifacts-with-jenkins.md), especially the ``abstract`` field.
  * Note: comments can only be single line
  * Note: Even if they are too long, they'll be cut to 30 words

### Adding a video to the publications

  * Add an md file to the folder: `videos/_posts` (You can use older videos post as a template)
  * Do not forget the attribute `video-url`, for youtube videos, use following format: https://www.youtube.com/embed/<video-id>
  * Add an image to the video, for youtube videos, make a screenshot [here](http://youtubescreenshot.com/), the image is used on the home page and the carousel. The image is to be saved under `/assets/img/custom/videos/`

# Troubleshooting

## Header files for ruby not found

This problem happens with Linux systems:

```
header files for ruby at /usr/lib/ruby/include/ruby.h not found
```

in case `ruby-dev` package is not installed:

```
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
```

## extconf.rb failed

`zlib` is necessary for building `libxml2`:

```
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
```
