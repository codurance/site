This post will endeavour to explore the reasons why developers do not like organisational change, and how not
recognising this could pose a big problem for your company. 

## No one likes change
Let me start off by saying that we as humans are not big advocates of change. To illustrate this, if I told you to move
house every week, you would probably not be overly enamoured by the idea. We seek stability the majority of the time.

This is not to say we do not seek change from time to time:

 * Move house
 * Change job
 * Re-decorate a room
 * Change your car

## No one likes to lose
From birth, it is pre-determined that we do not like losing. In the brilliant book 
[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0141033576) talks about gains
and losses. I won't delve into the details of Prospect Theory here, but if you want to understand more I suggest you
read the book.

In the book Kahneman explains how we react worse to losses than to gains, and we are much more sensitive to losses.
This fear of losing can help explain why developers are not fond of organisational changes.

For example, take the below scenario:
 

> Company X has an software engineering department that consists of ten developers.


Company X wish to make some changes, if you were one of those developers, which on of the below would you prefer?

> A - Company X proposes a change in which there is a 70% chance you will lose your job

> B - Company X proposes a change in which there is a 5% chance you will lose your job


If you are like the majority of people, you will prefer option `B`, despite the fact that both options present potential
losses (in this case, your job).

Unfortunately, when changes are proposed the facts are not known and so you would not be able to make such a decision as
above. There normally is a large amount of uncertainty, and your decision to remain at a company will be a gamble.

## The illusion of moving
When presented with an organisational change marked with much uncertainty, many think that moving company will be the
solution. However, this is an illusion and can often result in people hastily jumping ship and then having to do the
same at their new company because the grass was not in fact greener.

## Creatures of habit
As developers, we are creatures of habit. Much of the technologies we like is formed due to our familiarity with such
technologies. For example, say your favourite programming language is Java, this will most likely be because you have
a lot of experience using it and you have good memories programming in Java.

Now say your bosses tell you that you must now use C# instead, this conflicts with your passion for Java. You most
likely view this change as a loss, not a gain. Therefore you will most likely make a fuss and voice your dissatisfaction
of using C#.

## My advice to developers
In the event of you finding yourself in the middle of a proposed organisational change, seek out as much information as
possible to help you make your decision. See what you have to gain or lose from the change. If there is not much to lose
then I would recommend seeing how the change goes, you might find yourself in a situation where you can learn a lot.

## My advice to managers
Understand that developers, like anyone else, are creatures of habit and will be skeptical of change. Listen to
their views and provide them with enough information so they can make their own decision.
