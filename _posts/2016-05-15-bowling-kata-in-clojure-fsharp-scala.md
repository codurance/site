In one of our evening apprenticeship meetings, a pair was doing the [Bowling Kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataBowling) in Java. After reviewing their code, I thought that it would be a good idea to do it myself.

Every craftsman at Codurance is a polyglot developer and, although we have very similar values, we all have our own preferences when it comes to programming languages and coding styles. As you can imagine, we cannot always avoid cracking a joke or two about all the languages we don’t like so much but other craftsmen in the company do. So, just for fun, quite a few of us decided to do the same kata using our language of choice. It was great to see the same problem solved with different languages. Although there are still a few craftsmen and apprentices working on solving the kata in different languages, here are 3 of my favourite solutions so far (in no particular order):

## Clojure (by Mashooq)

```clojure
(ns bowling.core-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
            [bowling.core :refer :all]))

(deftest bowling 
  (testing "strikes for all rolls"
    (is (= 300 (score "XXXXXXXXXXXX"))))

  (testing "normal scores"
    (is (= 99 (score "91919393929291219191"))))

  (testing "normal scores or misses"
    (is (= 90 (score "9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-")))
    (is (= 93 (score "919-9-9-9-9-929-9-9-"))))
  
  (testing "mixture of stikes and normals"
    (is (= 98 (score "9-X8-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-")))
    (is (= 104 (score "9-X8-9-9-9-9-9-9-X23")))
    (is (= 28 (score "--X81--------------")))
    (is (= 27 (score "--X8-1-------------"))))
  
  (testing "spares for all rolls"
    (is (= 150 (score "5/5/5/5/5/5/5/5/5/5/5"))))

  (testing "mixture of spares and normals"
    (is (= 82 (score "9-8/--9-9-9-9-9-9-9-")))
    (is (= 84 (score "9-8/--9-9-9-9-9-9-9/1")))
    (is (= 12 (score "--8/1---------------")))
    (is (= 11 (score "--8/-1--------------")))))
```

```clojure
(ns bowling.core)

(defn- spare?[s] (= \/ s))
(defn- strike? [s] (= \X s))
(defn- spare-or-strike? [s] (or (spare? s) (strike? s)))
(defn- miss? [s] (or (= nil s) (= \- s)))

(defn- score-for [s] 
  (cond 
     (spare-or-strike? s)  10
     (miss? s)  0 
     :else (read-string (str s))))

(defn- score-roll [this-roll rem-rolls]
  (cond 
    (strike? this-roll) (+ 10 (score-for (first rem-rolls)) (score-for (first (rest rem-rolls))))
    (spare? this-roll) (+ 10 (score-for (first rem-rolls)))
    (spare? (first rem-rolls)) 0
    :else (score-for this-roll)))

(defn- score-rolls [acc rolls]
  (if (seq rolls)  
    (let [running-score (+ acc (score-roll (first rolls) (rest rolls)))]
      (score-rolls running-score (rest rolls)))
    acc))

(defn- expand-strikes [rolls]
  (seq (reduce str  (map #(if  (strike? %) "X-"  (str %)) (seq rolls)))))

(defn- deduct-extra-rolls [score rolls]
  (- score  (score-rolls 0 (drop 20 (expand-strikes rolls)))))

(defn score [rolls] 
  (deduct-extra-rolls (score-rolls 0 (seq rolls)) rolls))
```

## Fun, passion, and respect

Having fun at work, be surrounded by passionate and talented craftsmen, the respect we have for each other, and the willingness to learn and share, are some of the things I love the most about the Codurance’s culture. What started as apprentices practicing with a kata transformed into a great way to learn and share knowledge among craftsmen and apprentices. Some of our craftsmen and apprentices are also working on their solutions in Kotlin, Haskell, Java, and C#.

As among ourselves we will probably never agree which one we prefer, we will let you choose which one you like the most. :)

Thanks [Mash](https://twitter.com/mashooq) and [Pedro](https://twitter.com/pedromsantos) for the Clojure and F# implementations.
