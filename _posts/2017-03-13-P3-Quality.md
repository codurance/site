Do we know what is software quality? Is it measurable? If we want to improve the quality, do we know what to focus on?

Standards ISO/IEC 250xx provide a lot of metrics and guides to measure the quality of a product, but is that enough? What about the process that is followed to create that product? What about the team?

A lot of agile adoptions fail, because they only focus on the process, not on technical excellence.

That’s the reason why we need a global concept of quality, that we’ll call **P3 Quality**. If we want to ensure or improve quality, we should focus on:

* People
* Product
* Process

where the most important part is _people_:

That’s the reason of **Software Craftsmanship**.

When reading the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23215733-the-software-craftsman" target="_blank">“The Software Craftsman. Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride” by Sandro Mancuso</a>, you notice that the problems in software projects are the same, regardless of the company or the country, and the key to success is in the people’s quality, in our skills and attitude. That’s the importance in embracing Software Craftsmanship, always trying to improve, including ourselves.
