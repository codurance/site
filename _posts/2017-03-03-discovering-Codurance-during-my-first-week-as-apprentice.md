## Respect

Every morning, Sandro shakes hands with everyone when he arrives at the office. Everyday, everyone. I haven’t seen something similar in any company I’ve worked in and it’s an incredible example of respect and consideration.

## Transparency

Everyone knows all about the economic situation of the company, included salaries and salary reviews. This is an amazing example of transparency at all levels. 

## No personal offices, no assigned places

There are neither personal offices nor assigned places. There's only an open space where you can sit wherever you want. This approach “breaks” both the attachment to a place and the separation between roles.

## Learning and friendly atmosphere

Knowledge-sharing meetings are organized continuously in a natural way and in a friendly atmosphere. 

## Having a buddy

It’s the first time I had a _buddy_ designated to help me in my first days in a company. My buddy not only provided me with a "feel at home” feeling as soon as I arrived but also was worried about my convenience—I had just arrived from Spain to spend the whole month in London. He has also taught me a lot of things during my first week including technical skills, time management, how to acquire new skills, and gave me loads of advices and smiles. 

## Having a mentor

I have found a mentor in previous companies, but never about technical skills and with a plan of skills acquisition. Now I have an amazing person (technically and personally) designated to help me with my apprenticeship. I have no words to describe how much he has done for me during the week. 

I’m living a dream and I hope I don't wake up. Thanks for having me!
