Last weekend was a hectic one. I had many things planned for both Saturday and Sunday. Saturday, everything went according to plan. Sunday not so much. After arriving, on time, for my hair appointment, I was sat down (with my glass of water and 3 Lindt chocolates) to discuss the details with my designated stylist. Soon we both realised we have a problem. When I made the appointment, I asked for a "half head highlights", which turned out to be just a 30min appointment. What I really wanted was in fact a "pre-lighten regrowth and t-section", which needs a slot of at least 2 hours.
The only acceptable solution was to reschedule for later the day. The impact of using the wrong terminology in this situation was a personal fiasco as my whole day's plans went out the window. 

It made me realise once again the importance of communication and the use of a common language within a specific domain. As software developers, we work across various markets and domains and for every new project, we need to familiarise ourselves with the domain concepts to ensure the conceptual integrity of the applications we develop.

It was the same day, at the hairdresser's, I decided to write this blog, focusing on how context can change perceived understanding between different people. 

As it happens, I had recently experienced a personal change in perspective, related to blogging in general.

This is my first blog. Ever.

We live in a time of information overload. We are drowning in the abundance of opinions and regurgitations. Until now, my inner-critic prevented me from joining the masses of me-isms and self-promotion. Too much information is a problem in itself.

I've come to ponder the possibility that this perception may perhaps just be an excuse, a cop-out. I read somewhere recently "You are one in seven billionâ€”your progress is not meant for you alone." So, I started going down a different train of thought. Why not embrace the opportunities of the digital era? Share a bit about me, my perceptions and my personal experiences. Another way of looking at it, is that there are seven billion different perspectives on the human experience. It's an extraordinary thought.

Back to my topic of domain context, I want to share my appreciation of Domain Driven Development with the focus on raising awareness of the need for ubiquitous language and context. 
It's an old problem with pitfalls that many had to learn from, the hard way. As the saying goes, rather learn from other's mistakes than your own. It's less painful that way.

Here we have a guide, an approach to follow that increases your chance of success.
