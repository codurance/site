I was recently reading Gojko Adzic&#39;s blog
post called <a href="http://gojko.net/2011/04/05/how-is-it-even-possible-code-to-be-this-bad/">How is it even possible for code to be this
bad?</a>
I must admit that I was very sad to see tremendous lack of respect
towards the Hudson/Jenkins community and towards open source software
developers in general.

Firstly I would like to say that any person out there that is working on
an open source project deserves a lot of respect, mainly the ones
working on projects that bring so many benefits to so many companies and
developers around the world. The velocity that our industry moves
forward and evolves is, in general, because of many open source
initiatives. It&#39;s because of thousands of developers that work on the
their spare time, for free, to create software that will make the lives
of many other developers, companies and users much easier. These people
are kind enough to offer their work to all of us and are humble enough
to ask and accept help from many other developers around the globe. 

One thing we need to understand is that every project has a history and
many things, throughout the lifespan of a project, can be responsible
for the success or failure of a project. It&#39;s always easier to criticise
something instead of trying to help and make it better. As far as I&#39;m
aware, I don&#39;t think that anyone in the Hudson/Jenkins community ever
claimed that their code base is the best example of quality software
ever written and we all should learn from them. If that was the case,
probably it would justify such harsh words written in the original <a href="http://gojko.net/2011/04/05/how-is-it-even-possible-code-to-be-this-bad/">blog
post</a>. 

<blockquote>
The only acceptable form of criticism towards any open source project
or developer is constructive criticism.
</blockquote>

If we think that a open source project is below standard and/or not good
enough, we should either not use it or we should contribute to make it
better. 

However, I do understand the point Gojko is trying to make. Yes, I agree
that good code is not the only thing that makes a project be successful.
I think we all could name a few projects that we delivered where clients
and/or users were relatively happy but the code base was a bit messy.
There are always exceptions to the rules. Trying to get our code as
perfect and as clean as possible does not guarantee that our projects
will be successful and having a messy code does not always mean that our
project will fail either. We all know that. Even my 5 month-old baby
girl knows that. 

However, I totally disagree with Gojko&#39;s statement that &quot;<em>[Hudson&#39;s
success with &quot;bad&quot; code] is close to the final proof that God doesn&#39;t
exist for the whole craftsmanship debate</em>&quot;. It is almost like saying
that Agile is rubbish and everyone should forget about it just because
some waterfall projects succeeded. It is like saying that we all should
forget about good principles of software development just because some
projects succeeded with messy code. In summary, is like trying to get
some exceptions and transform them into rules. There are many ways and
many things that can contribute to the success of a project. Software
craftsmanship is one of them and a very important one. In a software
project, the most important thing is the software itself and looking
after its quality is an obligation of every developer involved in it.

<blockquote>
Although software craftsmanship on its own may not be enough to
guarantee the success of a project, the lack of it can be reason for
its failure. Single-handed.
</blockquote>

Another important point we should ask is the definition of a &quot;successful
project&quot; and in which context or environment but I&#39;ll leave that for
another post.

If exceptions invalidate rules and that is the way we should look at
things, does God exist for anything in software development?
