          <h2>How we grow?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Our people are our company and our product. Our company grows as our people grow. The culture of learning is ingrained into our very core. Our fortnightly catchups are focused around learning from each other. We run many internal sessions to build technologies expertise and hone our skills. We encourage and support each other to write blogs, record videos, organise community sessions, and present at conferences.</p>

        <p>We are proud organisers of the London Software Craftsmanship community and Socrates UK. Our people have the opportunity to take an active part in its organisation and, through the community, meet many like-minded people in the UK and across Europe.</p>

          <h2>Our people</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Our people have a very strong desire to master their software development skills, and support others in doing the same. Equally, our craftsmen are effective team members, committed to building the right software in the most effective way. We let our work speak for itself. We strive to constantly improve our selves, our team, and the projects we work in. Our craftsmen are pragmatic and understand that: knowing where to apply a particlar approach is as important as knowing how to apply it.</p>

        <p>We fully understand and embrace Agile processes and practices. We are skilled in practices such as TDD, Continuous Integration, Pair Programming, and Continuous Deployment.</p>

        <p> Our knowledge of technology is broad across the company and deep within the individuals. We are known for our expertise in: JVM, .NET and Node JS ecosystem, Web, Mobile, Big Data, and Cloud. Our craftsmen cover a wide range of technologies including but not limited to: Java, C#, Javascript, Scala, Clojure, F#, CSS, Cassandra, Kafka, AWS, and Azure. </p>

          <h2>Apprentice-craftsmen Programme</h2>
        </div>
        <p>We run the Apprentice-craftsmen Programme for people who share our passion for Software Craftsmanship but have not yet had the suitable learning opportunities. Each apprentice-crafts[wo]man selects a mentor, who will guide and support them during their apprenticeship. They work with their mentor, on a tailored programme of skill acqusition, culminating in graduating as a software crafts[wo]man. We avoid full-time client work for apprentice-craftsmen if we believe that it is not supporting their learning needs. The priority for them is to acquire the basic set of skills necessary to become recognised, as software crafts[wo]man, by the rest of the company. We regularly send our apprentice-craftsmen to training courses.</p>
