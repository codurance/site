  fullDescription: <p>Rob discovered his passion for software development at university. Shortly after landing his first job and being exposed to 'real world' projects, he discovered his passion for <em>well crafted</em> software.</p><p>Witnessing the frustration and inertia brought about by code that displayed the scars of corner-cutting and carelessness made him realise the importance of keeping the code clean. In his opinion, since software is eating the world, organisations that disregard the economics of flexible, robust software will ultimately fail.</p><p>To that end it's since been his goal to constantly improve himself as a software developer. Rob enjoys practising katas, working on open-source projects and being involved with the London Software Craftsmanship Community. He was a co-founder of the open-source Android MVVM framework 'Robobinding'.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>organisational structures and how they can help or hinder us from making awesome, usable software</li>
      <li>fixing teams, projects and software that are going badly</li>
      <li>making an api that encourages good development practices from consumers</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>He believes in the devops philosophy, and never leaves home without at least one way to develop F# (his current laptop has 3 - mono, .net core and visual studio). His current interest is machine learning, due to an unhealthy obsession with matrices that started some time during his uni years.</p>

At some point, he learned how to write instructions to the computer and take advantage of that for playing games... and he was astonished. From that moment, he realized that technologies had caught him.</p>
   <p>Always worried about how to answer questions like <i>"how can we make it better?"</i> or <i>"how this works?"</i>, he shares his knowledge with all the people he can, while at the same time tries to learn how to build better software. May be because of these reasons, he founded the <a href="http://www.barcelonajug.org">Barcelona Java Users Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.jbcnconf.com">Java and JVM Barcelona Conference</a>.</p>
   <p>He enjoys a lot spending time with his family (wife and daughter) and also likes to play many sports like body combat, basketball, football and running (marathons and even longer runs, but only by the mountains).</p>
