  fullDescription: <p>Rob discovered his passion for software development at university. Shortly after landing his first job and being exposed to 'real world' projects, he discovered his passion for <em>well crafted</em> software.</p><p>Witnessing the frustration and inertia brought about by code that displayed the scars of corner-cutting and carelessness made him realise the importance of keeping the code clean. In his opinion, since software is eating the world, organisations that disregard the economics of flexible, robust software will ultimately fail.</p><p>To that end it's since been his goal to constantly improve himself as a software developer. Rob enjoys practising katas, working on open-source projects and being involved with the London Software Craftsmanship Community. He was a co-founder of the open-source Android MVVM framework 'Robobinding'.</p>

      <li>fixing teams, projects and software that are going badly</li>
      <li>making an api that encourages good development practices from consumers</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>He believes in the devops philosophy, and never leaves home without at least one way to develop F# (his current laptop has 3 - mono, .net core and visual studio). His current interest is machine learning, due to an unhealthy obsession with matrices that started some time during his uni years.</p>
