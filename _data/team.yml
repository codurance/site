  fullDescription: <p>Rob discovered his passion for software development at university. Shortly after landing his first job and being exposed to 'real world' projects, he discovered his passion for <em>well crafted</em> software.</p><p>Witnessing the frustration and inertia brought about by code that displayed the scars of corner-cutting and carelessness made him realise the importance of keeping the code clean. In his opinion, since software is eating the world, organisations that disregard the economics of flexible, robust software will ultimately fail.</p><p>To that end it's since been his goal to constantly improve himself as a software developer. Rob enjoys practicising katas, working on open-source projects and being involved with the London Software Craftsmanship Community. He was a co-founder of the open-source Android MVVM framework 'Robobinding'.</p>

  fullDescription: <p> Amir joined as an apprentice shortly after graduating from university. In his time with us, he has discovered a great deal about what it means to be a software craftsman outside of just knowing how to write good code. Testing, automation, and risk mitigation have become an indispensable part of his work. In addition, Amir has learnt that a strong confident personality is sometimes needed alongside an open mind, and that colleagues & peers should be addressed in a manor that is equal parts welcoming and challenging.</p> <p> Since joining Codurance, Amir has excelled in up a variety of both technical and soft skills towards producing well-crafted software. He always brings an open-mind and an eagerness to learn. With all these factors and many more, Amir's passion for software has only gotten stronger and despite now having the title of craftsman, he feels as though his journey to mastering software craftsmanship is just beginning.</p>

In the last 20 years Tomaz has created successful software solutions for clients ranging from clinical biophysics, pharmacy, media agencies, metal industry to government institutions. He was also a co-founder of two software companies but could never resist working in development teams. Creating and contributing to more than ten software products played an important role in his career. It drastically changed his mindset from 'read manual to use software' to 'don't make me think' concept, trying to guess users interaction with the software, which was still developing.</p>
