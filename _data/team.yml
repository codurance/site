Shortly after landing his first job and being exposed to 'real world' projects, he discovered his passion for <em>well crafted</em> software.</p><p>Witnessing the frustration and inertia brought about by code that displayed the scars of corner-cutting and carelessness made him realise the importance of keeping the code clean. In his opinion, since software is eating the world, organisations that disregard the economics of flexible, robust software will ultimately fail.</p><p>To that end it's since been his goal to constantly improve himself as a software developer. Rob enjoys practising katas, working on open-source projects and being involved with the London Software Craftsmanship Community. He was a co-founder of the open-source Android MVVM framework 'Robobinding'.</p>

  fullDescription:
    <p>Sandro discovered his unmistakable passion for programming in 2016. From the onset, he became obsessed with doing things the right way. His hobby quickly became his addiction, as he spent any free time honing his skills.</p>
    <p>With a few IT certificates behind his name, he joined the Project codeX program in 2017 for an arduous year of Web Development in JavaScript, under the mentorship of a formidable Software Craftsman.</p>
    <p>In that year-long dojo, he learned to adopt and appreciate the values that constitute a successful craftsman. It felt wrong to write any code if its purpose wasn't meant to make a test pass.</p>
    <p>Test-driven development, pair programming, humility, communication, collaboration, passion, continuous learning, pragmatism, pride, respect, professionalism - all these terms became inextricably woven with his perception of a Software Craftsman.</p>
    <p>Above all, he aspires to be a true Craftsman, and looks forward to the lifelong journey.</p>
    <p>In his spare time, Sandro enjoys spending time with his loved ones, cooking and playing video games, like Dota 2 and Path of Exile.</p>
