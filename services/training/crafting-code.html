                        <strong>This course is designed to help developers write code that is well-crafted.</strong> Meaning code
                        that is clean, testable, maintainable, and an expression of the business domain. The course is entirely
                        hands-on, designed to teach developers practical techniques they can immediately apply to real-world
                        projects.</p>

            <h3>Course Duration</h3>
            <p>2 days</p>

            <h3>Why attend?</h3>
            <p><em>Software Craftsmanship</em> is at the heart of this course. Throughout, you will learn about the Software Craftsmanship attitude to development and how to apply it to your workplace.</p>
            <p>Writing <em>Clean Code</em> is difficult. Cleaning existing code, even more so. You should attend if you want to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Write clean code that is easy to
                    <em>understand</em> and
                    <em>maintain</em>
                </li>
                <li>Become more proficient in
                    <em>Test-Driven Development</em> (TDD): using tests to design and build your code base
                </li>
                <li>Focus your tests and production code according to business requirements using
                    <em>Outside-In TDD
                    </em> (a.k.a. the London School of TDD)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Clean code necessitates
                <em>good design</em>. In the process of driving your code through tests, you will learn how to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand design principles that lead to clean code</li>
                <li>
                    <em>Avoid over-engineering</em> and large rewrites by incrementally evolving your design using tests
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once you have an understanding of the principles at work, we will apply them to
                <em>Legacy Code
                </em> to help you gain confidence in improving legacy projects through testing, refactoring and redesigning.
