            entirely hands-on, designed to teach
            developers practical techniques they can immediately apply to real-world projects.</p>

            <h3>Why attend?</h3>
            <p><em>Software Craftsmanship</em> is at the heart of this course. Throughout, you will learn about
                the
                Software
                Craftsmanship attitude to development and how to apply it to your workplace.</p>

            <p>Writing <em>Clean Code</em> is difficult. Cleaning existing code, even more so. You should attend
                if you
                want to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Write clean code that is easy to <em>understand</em> and <em>maintain</em></li>
                <li>Become more proficient in <em>Test-Driven Development</em> (TDD): using tests to design and
                    build
                    your code base
                </li>
                <li>Focus your tests and production code according to business requirements using <em>Outside-In
                    TDD</em> (a.k.a. the London School of TDD)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Clean code necessitates <em>good design</em>. In the process of driving your code through tests,
                you
                will learn how to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand design principles that lead to clean code</li>
                <li><em>Avoid over-engineering</em> and large rewrites by incrementally evolving your design
                    using tests
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once you have an understanding of the principles at work, we will apply them to <em>Legacy
                Code</em> to
                help you gain
                confidence in improving legacy projects through testing, refactoring and redesigning.
