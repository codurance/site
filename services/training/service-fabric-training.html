        <p class="training-description margin-bottom-40"><strong>Microsoft Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices. </strong>This course will take attendees right from the basics of microservice architectures and Actor-based programming models, all the way up to building distributed, scalable stateless and stateful microservices with horizontal scalability and zero downtime. The course will be hands-on and attendees will be building their own solutions on Microsoft Azure and local Service Fabric clusters. </p>
