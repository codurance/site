              This course will provide the know-how to create Big Data scale platforms using a NoSQL database like Cassandra.
          </strong>
              This course will show why Cassandra is one of the highest-paying tech skills. Plenty of modern
              challenges are not suitable to RDBMS, hence being expert in polyglot persistence is a fundamental ability.
              NoSQL paradigm moves database concerns, traditionally assigned to DBAs, to developers. Being a well rounded
              developer is the key to success these days.

            <h3>Why Attend?</h3>
            <p>
              Three drivers are moving software development into Big Data arena: Internet scale, Analytics and IoT.
              Traditional RDBMS solutions are inefficient for those challenges and companies like Netflix or Ebay have
              chosen Cassandra as a proved solution that works.
            </p>
            <p>
              Low latency and high throughput are key factors for modern apps. Cassandra favours those over storage as
              commodity servers deployed on elastic cloud providers makes that trade-off really convenient.
            </p>
            <p>
              Customers expect zero downtime and high availability. Cassandra distributed architecture with tunable replication and
              no single point of failure is a perfect fit for achieving that operational excelence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mixing concerns like writes and reads leads to brittle applications and eventually to ORM hell. Cassandra enforces
              a flexible and performant data modeling style that suits well with architectures like CQRS or Event Sourcing.
            </p>
            <p>
              This course will give you the know-how through hands-on sessions on data modeling. We'll inspect locally deployed
              Cassandra clusters to confirm theoretical insights presented in the course.
