        <p class="training-description margin-bottom-40">
          <strong>
            This course will move Scala enthusiasts to the next level, introducing them to its most famous toolkit: Akka.
          </strong>
            Akka is the backbone of Scala ecosystem and any developer considering to work with Scala needs to know it well.
            Jumping from Scala basics to more advanced constructs can be daunting. This course focus on helping developers to achieve a proficient level with Akka, with a full hands-on content and down to earth code that exercises.

              JVM developers know how hard is to create and mantain multithreaded code. However in a world dominated by computers with several cores, mastering concurrency and parallelism is a must. Akka implements an abstraction
              called Actors that helps developers create applications with low latency and high throughput.

              Our world not only uses multi-core processors but several clustered machines, often deployed in the cloud.
              Akka Cluster provides an easy-to-use framework so you don't have to reinvent distributed wheels.

            <p>
              Microservices architecture suggests different communication protocols for different needs. It's usual to see
              HTTP for external communications and some async messaging engine for inter-service communication.
              Akka HTTP and Akka Streams are a proved solution for implementing that architecture and in this course we'll
              see how elegant are their APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Actors, currying, partial functions, type classes or functional composability are powerful constructs to take
              advantage of Scala. We'll learn by example reading and writing code related to the Akka toolkit.
