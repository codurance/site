            <p>
              Although Functional Programming is not a new thing, it has proved to be well suited for modern challenges. Leading companies, libraries and talented developers have already moved into the functional paradigm and Scala is the winner in the JVM. Thanks to its seamless Java inter-operability and its hybrid approach with OOP, Java developers will find in Scala a familiar, but exciting new environment.

              This course will focus on helping developers create readable and maintainable code, utilising Scala's type system to reduce bugs and make the code more expressive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iterating fast and safely is an important skill of any Agile team. Scala increases productivity and maintainability reducing a lot of boilerplate code that is so common in Java applications. With a big focus on testability and type safety (removing most of the bugs that developers battle every day in Java code), Scala is a great choice for achieving Continuous Delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe TDD is one of the best software development practices out there and we will use it throughout the course to teach the Scala language. The course is focused on exercises that will make you understand what is needed to craft real Scala business applications.
