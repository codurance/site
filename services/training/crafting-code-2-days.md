# Crafting Code - 2 days

This course is designed to help developers write code that is well-crafted; code that is clean, testable, maintainable, and an expression of the business domain. The course is entirely hands-on, designed to teach developers practical techniques they can immediately apply to real-world projects.

## Why attend?

**Software Craftsmanship** is at the heart of this course. Throughout, you will learn about the Software Craftsmanship attitude to development and how to apply it to your workplace.

Writing **Clean Code** is difficult. Cleaning existing code, even more so. You should attend if you want to:

* Write clean code that is easy to **understand** and **maintain**
* Become more proficient in **Test-Driven Development** (TDD): using tests to design and build your code base
* Focus your tests and production code according to business requirements using **Outside-In TDD** (a.k.a. the London School of TDD)

Clean code necessitates **good design**. In the process of driving your code through tests, you will learn how to:

* Understand design principles that lead to clean code
* **Avoid over-engineering** and large rewrites by incrementally evolving your design using tests

Once you have an understanding of the principles at work, we will apply them to **Legacy Code** to help you gain confidence in improving legacy projects through testing, refactoring and redesigning.

## Content

* TDD lifecycle and the London School of TDD
* Writing unit tests that express intent, not implementation
* Using unit tests as a tool to drive good design
* Expressive code
* Testing and refactoring Legacy Code
* Introduction to SOLID Principles and Domain-Driven Design

The course is fully hands-on and developers will be writing a lot of code.

## Audience

Software developers that:

* are familiar with at least one Object-Oriented language
* are able to understand Java or C#
* can write and execute unit tests using a framework (such as JUnit, NUnit, etc.)
* have a basic understanding of mock objects

## Prerequisites

Developers must:

* bring their own laptops
* have a development environment consisting of:
  * their favourite Object-Oriented language
  * a unit test framework
  * a mocking library
* be able to create projects, build source code and run test cases in their development environment

In addition, a distributed version-control system such as Git is desirable.
